Diagrams in the [Draw.io](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio) `example-model.drawio` file are exported as `*.svg` and then embedded into the `.md` files without changes.

Note: star `*` characters in a diagram description needs to be escaped as `\*` to avoid 
interpretation as markdown.
