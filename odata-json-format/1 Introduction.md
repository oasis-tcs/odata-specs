# ##sec Introduction

The OData protocol is comprised of a set of specifications for representing and interacting with structured content. The core specification for the protocol is in [OData-Protocol](#ODataProtocol); this document is an extension of the core protocol. This document defines representations for the OData requests and responses using the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), see [RFC8259].

An OData JSON payload may represent:

<!--TODO: insert links to sections -->
- a single primitive value
- a collection of primitive values
- a single complex type value
- a collection of complex type values
- a single entity or entity reference
- a collection of entities or entity references
- a collection of changes
- a service document describing the top-level resources exposed by the service
- an error.

## ##subsec Changes from earlier Versions

<!-- TODO -->
<!-- Describe significant changes from previous differently-numbered Versions, not changes between stages of the current Version -->

## ##subsec Glossary

### ##subsubsec Definitions of terms

<!-- TODO -->

### ##subsubsec Acronyms and abbreviations

### ##subsubsec Document conventions

Keywords defined by this specification use `this monospaced font`.

Some sections of this specification are illustrated with non-normative examples.

::: example
Example ##ex: text describing an example uses this paragraph style
```
Non-normative examples use this paragraph style.
```
:::

All examples in this document are non-normative and informative only. Examples labeled with âš  contain advanced concepts or make use of keywords that are defined only later in the text, they can be skipped at first reading.

All other text is normative unless otherwise labeled.

::: example
Here is a customized command line which will generate HTML from this markdown file (named `$$$filename$$$.md`). Line breaks are added for readability only:

```
pandoc -f gfm+tex_math_dollars+fenced_divs
       -t html
       -o $$$filename$$$.html
       -c styles/markdown-styles-v1.7.3b.css
       -c styles/odata.css
       -s
       --mathjax
       --eol=lf
       --wrap=none
       --metadata pagetitle="$$$pagetitle$$$"
       $$$filename$$$.md
```

This uses pandoc 3.1.2 from https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/3.1.2.

<!-- Required section -->

`(Note: The [OASIS TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26/#wpComponentsConfClause) requires that a specification approved by the TC at the Committee Specification Public Review Draft, Committee Specification or OASIS Standard level must include a separate section, listing a set of numbered conformance clauses, to which any implementation of the specification must adhere in order to claim conformance to the specification (or any optional portion thereof). This is done by listing the conformance clauses here.`
`For the definition of "conformance clause," see [OASIS Defined Terms](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dConformanceClause).`
