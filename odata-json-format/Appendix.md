# Appendix ##asec Safety, Security and Privacy Considerations

<!-- Optional section -->

`(Note: OASIS strongly recommends that Technical Committees consider issues that might affect safety, security, privacy, and/or data protection in implementations of their specification and document them for implementers and adopters. For some purposes, you may find it required, e.g. if you apply for IANA registration.`

`While it may not be immediately obvious how your specification might make systems vulnerable to attack, most specifications, because they involve communications between systems, message formats, or system settings, open potential channels for exploit. For example, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)] lists “eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middle” as well as potential denial of service attacks as threats that must be considered and, if appropriate, addressed in IETF RFCs.`

`In addition to considering and describing foreseeable risks, this section should include guidance on how implementers and adopters can protect against these risks.`

`We encourage editors and TC members concerned with this subject to read _Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations_, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)], for more information.`

`Remove this note before submitting for publication.)`

# Appendix ##asec Acknowledgments

<!-- Required section -->

`Note: A Work Product approved by the TC must include a list of people who participated in the development of the Work Product. This is generally done by collecting the list of names in this appendix. This list shall be initially compiled by the Chair, and any Member of the TC may add or remove their names from the list by request. Remove this note before submitting for publication.`

## ##subasec Special Thanks

<!-- This is an optional subsection to call out contributions from TC members. If a TC wants to thank non-TC members then they should avoid using the term "contribution" and instead thank them for their "expertise" or "assistance". -->

Substantial contributions to this document from the following individuals are gratefully acknowledged:

Participant Name, Affiliation or "Individual Member"

## ##subasec Participants

<!-- A TC can determine who they list here, however, TC Observers must not be listed. It is common practice for TCs to list everyone that was part of the TC during the creation of the document, but this is ultimately a TC decision on who they want to list and not list, and in what order. -->

\[OASIS requests that any OASIS Party or any other party that believes it has patent claims that would necessarily be infringed by implementations of this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable, to notify OASIS TC Administrator and provide an indication of its willingness to grant patent licenses to such patent claims in a manner consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS Technical Committee that produced this deliverable.\]

\[OASIS invites any party to contact the OASIS TC Administrator if it is aware of a claim of ownership of any patent claims that would necessarily be infringed by implementations of this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable by a patent holder that is not willing to provide a license to such patent claims in a manner consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS Technical Committee that produced this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable. OASIS may include such claims on its website, but disclaims any obligation to do so.\]

OASIS makes no representation that any information or list of intellectual property rights will at any time be complete, or that any claims in such list are, in fact, Essential Claims.\]
