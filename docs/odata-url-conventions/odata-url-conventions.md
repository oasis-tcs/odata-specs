# <a name="Introduction" href="#Introduction">1 Introduction</a>

The Open Data Protocol (OData) enables the creation of REST-based data
services, which allow resources, identified using Uniform Resource
Locators (URLs) and defined in a data model, to be published and edited
by Web clients using simple HTTP messages. This specification defines a
set of recommended (but not required) rules for constructing URLs to
identify the data and metadata exposed by an OData service as well as a
set of reserved URL query string operators, which if accepted by an
OData service, MUST be implemented as required by this document.

The [OData-JSON](#ODataJSON) document specifies the format of the
resource representations that are exchanged using OData and the
[OData-Protocol](#ODataProtocol) document describes the actions that can be
performed on the URLs (optionally constructed following the conventions
defined in this document) embedded in those representations.

Services are encouraged to follow the URL construction conventions
defined in this specification when possible as consistency promotes an
ecosystem of reusable client components and libraries.

# <a name="URLComponents" href="#URLComponents">2 URL Components</a>

A URL used by an OData service has at most three significant parts: the
*service root URL*, the *resource path*, and *query options*. Additional
URL constructs (such as a fragment) can be present in a URL used by an
OData service; however, this specification applies no further meaning to
such additional constructs.

::: example
Example 2: OData URL broken down into its component parts:
```
http://host:port/path/SampleService.svc/Categories(1)/Products?$top=2&$orderby=Name
\______________________________________/\____________________/ \__________________/
                  |                               |                       |
          service root URL                  resource path           query options
```
:::

Mandated and suggested content of these three significant URL components
used by an OData service are covered in sequence in the three following
chapters.

## <a name="URLParsing" href="#URLParsing">2.1 URL Parsing</a>

OData follows the URI syntax rules defined in [RFC3986](#rfc3986) and in
addition assigns special meaning to several of the sub-delimiters
defined by [RFC3986](#rfc3986), so special care has to be taken
regarding parsing and percent-decoding.

[RFC3986](#rfc3986) defines three steps for URL processing that MUST be
performed before percent-decoding:
- Split undecoded URL into components
scheme, hier-part, query, and fragment
- Split undecoded hier-part into authority
and path
- Split undecoded path into path segments

After applying these steps defined by RFC3986 the following steps MUST
be performed:
- Split undecoded query at "`&`" (octet `0x26`) into
query options, and each query option at the first "`=`" (octet `0x3D`) into query
option name and query option value
- Percent-decode path segments, query
option names, and query option values exactly once
- Interpret path segments, query option
names, and query option values according to OData rules

Note: neither [RFC3986](#rfc3986) nor this specification assign special meaning to "`+`" (octet `0x2B`).
Some implementations decode "`+`" (octet `0x2B`) as space (octet `0x20`), others take it literally.

Clients SHOULD percent-encode space (octet `0x20`) as `%20` and "`+`" (octet `0x2B`) as `%2B` and avoid the ambiguous "`+`" (octet `0x2B`) in URLs.

## <a name="URLSyntax" href="#URLSyntax">2.2 URL Syntax</a>

The OData syntax rules for URLs are defined in this document and the
[OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF). Note that the ABNF is not expressive enough to
define what a correct OData URL is in every imaginable use case. This
specification document defines additional rules that a correct OData URL
MUST fulfill. In case of doubt on what makes an OData URL correct the
rules defined in this specification document take precedence. Note also
that the rules in [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF) assume that URLs and URL
parts have been percent-encoding normalized as described in
[section 6.2.2.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-6.2.2.2)
of [RFC3986](#rfc3986) before applying the grammar to them, i.e.
all characters in the unreserved set (see rule `unreserved` in [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF)) are plain literals and not percent-encoded.
For characters outside of the unreserved set that are significant to
OData the ABNF rules explicitly state whether the percent-encoded
representation is treated identical to the plain literal representation.
This is done to make the input strings in the ABNF test cases more
readable.

For example, one of these rules is that single quotes within string
literals are represented as two consecutive single quotes.

::: example
Example 3: valid OData URLs:
```
http://host/service/People('O''Neil')
```

```
http://host/service/People(%27O%27%27Neil%27)
```

```
http://host/service/People%28%27O%27%27Neil%27%29
```

```
http://host/service/Categories('Smartphone%2FTablet')
```
:::

::: example
Example 4: invalid OData URLs:
```
http://host/service/People('O'Neil')
```

```
http://host/service/People('O%27Neil')
```

```
http://host/service/Categories('Smartphone/Tablet')
```
:::

The first and second examples are invalid because a single quote in a
string literal must be represented as two consecutive single quotes. The
third example is invalid because forward slashes are interpreted as path
segment separators and `Categories('Smartphone` is not a valid OData
path segment, nor is `Tablet')`.

-------

# <a name="ServiceRootURL" href="#ServiceRootURL">3 Service Root URL</a>

The service root URL identifies the root of an OData service. A `GET`
request to this URL returns the format-specific service document, see
[OData-JSON](#ODataJSON).

The service root URL MUST terminate in a forward slash.

The service document enables simple hypermedia-driven clients to
enumerate and explore the resources published by the OData service.


-------

# <a name="ResourcePath" href="#ResourcePath">4 Resource Path</a>

The rules for resource path construction as defined in this section are
optional. OData services SHOULD follow the subsequently described URL
path construction rules and are indeed encouraged to do so; as such
consistency promotes a rich ecosystem of reusable client components and
libraries.

Services that do not follow the resource path conventions for entity
container children are strongly encouraged to document their resource
paths by annotating entity container children with the term
[`Core.ResourcePath`](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/master/vocabularies/Org.OData.Core.V1.md#ResourcePath)
defined in [OData-VocCore](#ODataVocCore). The annotation value is the
URL of the annotated resource and may be relative to `xml:base` (if
present), otherwise the request URL.

Resources exposed by an OData service are addressable by corresponding
resource path URL components to enable interaction of the client with
that resource aspect.

To illustrate the concept, some examples for resources might be:
customers, a single customer, orders related to a single customer, and
so forth. Examples of addressable aspects of these resources as exposed
by the data model might be: collections of entities, a single entity,
properties, links, operations, and so on.

An OData service MAY respond with `301 Moved Permanently` or
`307 Temporary Redirect` from the canonical URL to the actual URL.

## <a name="AddressingtheModelforaService" href="#AddressingtheModelforaService">4.1 Addressing the Model for a Service</a>

OData services expose their entity model according to
[OData-CSDLJSON](#ODataCSDL) or [OData-CSDLXML](#ODataCSDL) at the
metadata URL, formed by appending `$metadata` to the [service root
URL](#ServiceRootURL).

::: example
Example 5: Metadata document URL
```
http://host/service/$metadata
```
:::

OData clients may request a particular format for metadata either
through the `Accept` header or by using the
[`$format`](#SystemQueryOptionformat) system query option.

::: example
Example 6: Metadata document URL with specified format
```
http://host/service/$metadata?$format=json
```
:::

## <a name="AddressingtheBatchEndpointforaService" href="#AddressingtheBatchEndpointforaService">4.2 Addressing the Batch Endpoint for a Service</a>

OData services that support batch requests expose a batch URL formed by
appending `$batch` to the [service root URL](#ServiceRootURL).

::: example
Example 7: batch URL
```
http://host/service/$batch
```

## <a name="AddressingEntities" href="#AddressingEntities">4.3 Addressing Entities</a>

The basic rules for addressing a collection (of entities), a single
entity within a collection, a singleton, as well as a property of an
entity are covered in the `resourcePath` syntax rule in
[OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF).

Below is a (non-normative) snippet from [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF):

```
resourcePath = entitySetName                  [collectionNavigation]
             / singletonEntity                [singleNavigation]
             / actionImportCall
             / entityColFunctionImportCall    [ collectionNavigation ]
             / entityFunctionImportCall       [ singleNavigation ]
             / complexColFunctionImportCall   [ collectionPath ]
             / complexFunctionImportCall      [ complexPath ]
             / primitiveColFunctionImportCall [ collectionPath ]
             / primitiveFunctionImportCall    [ primitivePath ]
             / functionImportCallNoParens     [ querySegment ]
             / crossjoin                      [ querySegment ]
             / %s"$all"                       [ "/" optionallyQualifiedEntityTypeName ]
```

Since OData has a uniform composable URL syntax and associated rules
there are many ways to address a collection of entities, including, but
not limited to:
- Via an entity set (see rule `entitySetName` in [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF))

::: example
Example 8:
```
http://host/service/Products
```
:::

- By navigating a collection-valued
navigation property (see rule: `entityColNavigationProperty`)
- By invoking a function import that returns a
collection of entities (see rule: `entityColFunctionImportCall`)

::: example
Example 9: function with parameters in resource path
```
http://host/service/ProductsByCategoryId(categoryId=2)
```
:::

::: example
Example 10: function with parameters as query options
```
http://host/service/ProductsByColor(color=@color)?@color='red'
```
:::

- By invoking an action import that returns a
collection of entities (see rule: `actionImportCall`)

Likewise there are many ways to address a single entity.

Sometimes a single entity can be accessed directly, for example by:
- Invoking a function import that returns a
single entity (see rule: `entityFunctionImportCall`)
- Invoking an action import that returns a single
entity (see rule: `actionImportCall`)
- Addressing a singleton

::: example
Example 11:
```
http://host/service/BestProductEverCreated
```
:::

Often however a single entity is accessed by composing more path
segments to a `resourcePath` that identifies a collection of entities,
for example by:
- Using an entity key to select a single
entity (see rules: `collectionNavigation` and `keyPredicate`)

::: example
Example 12:
```
http://host/service/Categories(1)
```
:::

- Invoking an action bound to a collection
of entities that returns a single entity (see rule: `boundOperation`)
- Invoking an function bound to a
collection of entities that returns a single entity (see rule:
`boundOperation`)

::: example
Example 13:
```
http://host/service/Products/Model.MostExpensive()
```
:::

These rules are recursive, so it is possible to address a single entity
via another single entity, a collection via a single entity and even a
collection via a collection; examples include, but are not limited to:
- By following a navigation from a single
entity to another related entity (see rule: `entityNavigationProperty`)

::: example
Example 14:
```
http://host/service/Products(1)/Supplier
```
:::

- By invoking a function bound to a single
entity that returns a single entity (see rule: `boundOperation`)

::: example
Example 15:
```
http://host/service/Products(1)/Model.MostRecentOrder()
```
:::

- By invoking an action bound to a single
entity that returns a single entity (see rule: `boundOperation`)
- By following a navigation from a single
entity to a related collection of entities (see rule:
`entityColNavigationProperty`)

::: example
Example 16:
```
http://host/service/Categories(1)/Products
```
:::

- By invoking a function bound to a single
entity that returns a collection of entities (see rule:
`boundOperation`)

::: example
Example 17:
```
http://host/service/Categories(1)/Model.TopTenProducts()
```
:::

- By invoking an action bound to a single
entity that returns a collection of entities (see rule:
`boundOperation`)
- By invoking a function bound to a
collection of entities that returns a collection of entities (see rule:
`boundOperation`)

::: example
Example 18:
```
http://host/service/Categories(1)/Products/Model.AllOrders()
```
:::

- By invoking an action bound to a
collection of entities that returns a collection of entities (see rule:
`boundOperation`)

Finally it is possible to compose path segments onto a resource path
that identifies a primitive, complex instance, collection of primitives
or collection of complex instances and bind an action or function that
returns an entity or collections of entities.

### <a name="CanonicalURL" href="#CanonicalURL">4.3.1 Canonical URL</a>

For OData services conformant with the addressing conventions in this
section, the canonical form of an absolute URL identifying a
non-contained entity is formed by adding a single path segment to the
service root URL. The path segment is made up of the name of the entity
set associated with the entity followed by the key predicate identifying
the entity within the collection. No [type-cast segment](#AddressingDerivedTypes) is added to the
canonical URL, even if the entity is an instance of a type derived from
the declared entity type of its entity set.

The canonical key predicate for single-part keys consists only of the
key property value without the key property name. For multi-part keys
the key properties appear in the same order they appear in the key
definition in the service metadata.

::: example
Example 19: Non-canonical URL
```
http://host/service/Categories(ID=1)/Products(ID=1)
```
:::

::: example
Example 20: Canonical URL for previous example:
```
http://host/service/Products(1)
```
:::

### <a name="CanonicalURLforContainedEntities" href="#CanonicalURLforContainedEntities">4.3.2 Canonical URL for Contained Entities</a>

For contained entities (i.e. related via a containment navigation
property, see [OData-CSDLJSON](#ODataCSDL) or
[OData-CSDLXML](#ODataCSDL)) the canonical URL is the canonical URL of
the containing entity followed by:
- A [type-cast segment](#AddressingDerivedTypes) if the navigation
property is defined on a type derived from the entity type declared for
the entity set,
- A path segment for the containment
navigation property, and
- If the navigation property returns a
collection, a key predicate that uniquely identifies the entity in that
collection.

If the containment navigation property is defined on a complex type used
within an ordered collection, the canonical URL of the containing entity
is the canonical URL for the collection of complex types followed by a
segment containing the zero-based ordinal of the complex typed instance
within the collection.

### <a name="URLsforRelatedEntitieswithReferentialConstraints" href="#URLsforRelatedEntitieswithReferentialConstraints">4.3.3 URLs for Related Entities with Referential Constraints</a>

If a navigation property leading to a related entity type has a partner
navigation property that specifies a referential constraint, then those
key properties of the related entity that take part in the referential
constraint MAY be omitted from URLs.

::: example
Example 21: full key predicate of related entity
```
https://host/service/Orders(1)/Items(OrderID=1,ItemNo=2)
```
:::

::: example
Example 22: shortened key predicate of related entity
```
https://host/service/Orders(1)/Items(2)
```
The two above examples are equivalent if the navigation property `Items`
from `Order` to `OrderItem` has a partner navigation property from
`OrderItem` to `Order` with a referential constraint tying the value of
the `OrderID` key property of the `OrderItem` to the value of the `ID`
key property of the `Order`.
:::

The shorter form that does not specify the constrained key parts
redundantly is preferred. If the value of the constrained key is
redundantly specified, then it MUST match the principal key value.

### <a name="ResolvinganEntityId" href="#ResolvinganEntityId">4.3.4 Resolving an Entity-Id</a>

To resolve an entity-id into a representation of the identified entity,
the client issues a `GET` request to the `$entity` resource located at
the URL `$entity` relative to the service root URL. The entity-id MUST
be specified using the system query option `$id`. The entity-id may be
expressed as an absolute IRI or relative to the request root URL.

::: example
Example 23: request the entity representation for an entity-id
```
http://host/service/$entity?$id=Products(0)
```
:::

The semantics of `$entity` are covered in the [OData-Protocol](#ODataProtocol)
document.

### <a name="AlternateKeys" href="#AlternateKeys">4.3.5 Alternate Keys</a>

In addition to the canonical (primary) key an entity set or entity type
can specify one or more alternate keys with the
[`Core.AlternateKeys`](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/master/vocabularies/Org.OData.Core.V1.md#AlternateKeys)
term (see [OData-VocCore](#ODataVocCore)). Entities can be addressed via
an alternate key using the same parentheses-style convention as for the
canonical key, with one difference: single-part alternate keys MUST
specify the key property name to unambiguously determine the alternate
key.

::: example
Example 24: the same employee identified via the alternate key SSN, the
canonical (primary) key ID using the non-canonical long form with
specified key property name, and the canonical short form without key
property name
```
http://host/service/Employees(SSN='123-45-6789')
```

```
http://host/service/Employees(ID='A1245')
```

```
http://host/service/Employees('A1245')
```
:::

### <a name="KeyasSegmentConvention" href="#KeyasSegmentConvention">4.3.6 Key-as-Segment Convention</a>

Services MAY support an alternate convention for addressing entities by
appending a segment containing the unprefixed and unquoted key value to the URL of the
collection containing the entity. Forward-slashes in key value segments
MUST be percent-encoded; single quotes within key value segments are
treated as part of the key value and do not need to be doubled or
percent encoded.

::: example
Example 25: valid OData URLs:
```
http://host/service/Employees/A1245
```

```
http://host/service/People/O'Neil
```

```
http://host/service/People/O%27Neil
```

```
http://host/service/Categories/Smartphone%2FTablet
```

```
http://host/service/ThingyWithDurationKey/P12DT23H59M59.999999999999S
```

```
http://host/service/ThingyWithEnumerationKey/Yellow
```
:::

For multi-part keys, the entity MUST be addressed by multiple segments
applied, one for each key value, in the order they appear in the
metadata description of the entity key.

::: example
Example 26: multi-part key predicate, parentheses-style and
key-as-segment
```
https://host/service/OrderItems(OrderID=1,ItemNo=2)
```

```
https://host/service/OrderItems/1/2
```
:::

If a navigation property leading to a related entity type has a partner
navigation property that specifies a referential constraint, then those
key properties of the related entity that take part in the referential
constraint MUST be omitted from URLs using key-as-segment convention.

::: example
Example 27: key predicate of related entity --- no key segments for key
properties of related entity with a referential constraint to preceding
key segments
```
https://host/service/Orders/1/Items/2
```
The above example assumes that the navigation property `Items` from
`Order` to `OrderItem` has a partner navigation property from
`OrderItem` to `Order` with a referential constraint tying the value of
the `OrderID` key property of the `OrderItem` to the value of the `ID`
key property of the `Order`.
:::

Because representing key values as segments could be ambiguous with
other URL construction conventions, services that support key-as segment
MUST implement the following precedence rules:

If a segment following an entity collection:
1. matches a defined OData segment (starting with "`$`"), treat it as
such
2. matches a qualified bound function, bound action, or type name,
treat it as such
3. matches an unqualified bound function, bound action, or type name
defined in a default namespace (see [OData-Protocol](#ODataProtocol)) treat it
as such
4. treat as a key value

For maximum interoperability, services that support the key-as-segment
convention SHOULD also support the canonical [parentheses-style
convention](#CanonicalURL) for addressing an entity within a collection,
otherwise they MUST specify the URL for each returned entity in a
response, as specified by the particular format.

Note: the key-as-segment convention can only be used with the canonical
(primary) key and cannot be used with alternate keys as the key property
names are not present in the keys and an alternative key cannot be
determined.

## <a name="AddressingReferencesbetweenEntities" href="#AddressingReferencesbetweenEntities">4.4 Addressing References between Entities</a>

OData services are based on a data model that supports relationships as
first class constructs. For example, an OData service could expose a
collection of Products entities each of which are related to a Category
entity.

References between entities are addressable in OData just like entities
themselves are (as described above) by appending a navigation property
name followed by `/$ref` to the entity URL.

::: example
Example 28: URL addressing the references between `Categories(1)` and
`Products`
```
http://host/service/Categories(1)/Products/$ref
```
:::

Resource paths addressing a single related entity reference can be used
in `DELETE` requests to unrelate two entities. In OData 4.01, this
includes resource paths that identify an individual entity reference
within a related collection by key. In OData 4.0, resource paths
addressing a collection of references MUST be followed by the system
query option `$id` in order to identify a single entity reference within
the collection to be removed. The entity-id specified by `$id` may be
expressed absolute or relative to the request URL. For details see
[OData-Protocol](#ODataProtocol).

::: example
Example 29: three ways of unrelating `Categories(1)` and
`Products(0)`; the second option is supported only in OData 4.01
```
DELETE http://host/service/Categories(1)/Products/$ref?$id=../../Products(0)
```

```
DELETE http://host/service/Categories(1)/Products(0)/$ref
```

```
DELETE http://host/service/Products(0)/Category/$ref
```
:::

## <a name="AddressingOperations" href="#AddressingOperations">4.5 Addressing Operations</a>

The semantic rules for addressing and invoking actions and functions are
defined in the [OData-Protocol](#ODataProtocol) document.

Services MAY additionally support the use of the unqualified name of an
action or function in a URL by defining one or more default namespaces
through the
[`Core.DefaultNamespace`](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/master/vocabularies/Org.OData.Core.V1.md#DefaultNamespace) term
defined in [OData-VocCore](#ODataVocCore). For more information on
default namespaces, see Default Namespaces in [OData-Protocol](#ODataProtocol).

### <a name="AddressingActions" href="#AddressingActions">4.5.1 Addressing Actions</a>

The grammar for addressing and invoking actions is defined by the
following syntax grammar rules in [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF):
- The `actionImportCall` syntax rule
defines the grammar in the `resourcePath` for addressing and invoking an
action import directly from the service root.
- The `boundActionCall` syntax rule
defines the grammar in the `resourcePath` for addressing and invoking an
action that is appended to a `resourcePath` that identifies some
resources that can be used as the binding parameter value when invoking
the action.
- The `boundOperation` syntax rule (which
encompasses the `boundActionCall` syntax rule), when used by the
`resourcePath` syntax rule, illustrates how a `boundActionCall` can be
appended to a `resourcePath`.

### <a name="AddressingFunctions" href="#AddressingFunctions">4.5.2 Addressing Functions</a>

The grammar for addressing and invoking functions is defined by a number
syntax grammar rules in [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF), in particular:
- The function import call syntax rules
`complexFunctionImportCall`, `complexColFunctionImportCall`,
`entityFunctionImportCall`, `entityColFunctionImportCall`,
`primitiveFunctionImportCall`, and `primitiveColFunctionImportCall`
define the grammar in the `resourcePath` for addressing and providing
parameters for a function import directly from the service root.
- The bound function call syntax rules
`boundComplexFunctionCall`, `boundComplexColFunctionCall`,
`boundEntityFunctionCall`, `boundEntityColFunctionCall`,
`boundPrimitiveFunctionCall` and `boundPrimitiveColFunctionCall` define
the grammar in the `resourcePath` for addressing and providing
parameters for a function that is appended to a `resourcePath` that
identifies some resources that can be used as the binding parameter
value when invoking the function.
- The `boundOperation` syntax rule (which
encompasses the bound function call syntax rules), when used by the
`resourcePath` syntax rule, illustrates how a bound function call can be
appended to a `resourcePath`.
- The `functionExpr` and
`boundFunctionExpr` syntax rules as used by the `commonExpr`
syntax rule define the grammar for invoking functions, for example to help filter
and order resources identified by the `resourcePath` of the URL.
- The `aliasAndValue` syntax rule defines
the grammar for providing function parameter values using Parameter
Alias Syntax, see [OData-Protocol](#ODataProtocol).

## <a name="AddressingaProperty" href="#AddressingaProperty">4.6 Addressing a Property</a>

To address an entity property clients append a path segment containing
the property name to the URL of the entity. If the property has a
complex type value, properties of that value can be addressed by further
property name composition.

## <a name="AddressingaRawValue" href="#AddressingaRawValue">4.7 Addressing a Raw Value</a>

To address the raw value of a primitive property or operation result, clients append the
path segment `/$value` to the property or operation URL.

Properties and operation results of type `Edm.Stream` already return the raw value of the
media stream and do not support appending the `/$value` segment.

## <a name="AddressingtheCountofaCollection" href="#AddressingtheCountofaCollection">4.8 Addressing the Count of a Collection</a>

To address the raw value of the number of items in a collection, clients
append `/$count` to the resource path of the URL identifying the entity
set or collection.

The `/$count` path suffix identifies the integer count of records in the
collection and SHOULD NOT be combined with the system query options
[`$top`](#SystemQueryOptionstopandskip),
[`$skip`](#SystemQueryOptionstopandskip),
[`$orderby`](#SystemQueryOptionorderby),
[`$expand`](#SystemQueryOptionexpand), and
[`$format`](#SystemQueryOptionformat). The count MUST NOT be affected
by `$top`, `$skip`, `$orderby`, or `$expand`.

The count is calculated after applying any
[`/$filter`](#AddressingaSubsetofaCollection) path segments, or
[`$filter`](#SystemQueryOptionfilter) or [`$search`](#SystemQueryOptionsearch) system query options to the collection.

::: example
Example 30: the number of related entities
```
http://host/service/Categories(1)/Products/$count
```
:::

::: example
Example 31: the number of entities in an entity set
```
http://host/service/Products/$count
```
:::

::: example
Example 32: entity count in a `$filter`
expression. Note that the spaces around `gt` are for readability of the
example only; in real URLs they must be percent-encoded as `%20`.
```
http://host/service/Categories?$filter=Products/$count gt 0
```
:::

::: example
Example 33: count of a filtered collection in a
`$filter` expression; returns all Categories
containing more than two products whose price is greater than 5.00.
```
http://host/service/Categories?$filter=Products/$count($filter=Price gt 5.00) gt 2

:::

## <a name="AddressingaMemberwithinanEntityCollection" href="#AddressingaMemberwithinanEntityCollection">4.9 Addressing a Member within an Entity Collection</a>

Collections of entities are modeled as entity sets, collection-valued
navigation properties, or operation results.

For entity sets, results of operations associated with an entity set
through an `EntitySet` or `EntitySetPath` declaration, or
collection-valued navigation properties with a
`NavigationPropertyBinding` or `ContainsTarget=true` specification,
members of the collection can be addressed by convention by appending
the parenthesized key to the URL specifying the collection of entities,
or by using the [key-as-segment convention](#KeyasSegmentConvention) if
supported by the service.

For collection-valued navigation properties with navigation property
bindings that end in a [type-cast segment](#AddressingDerivedTypes),
a [type-cast segment](#AddressingDerivedTypes) MUST be
appended to the collection URL before appending the key segment.

Note: entity sets or collection-valued navigation properties annotated
with the term
[`Capabilities.IndexableByKey`](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/master/vocabularies/Org.OData.Capabilities.V1.md#IndexableByKey)
defined in [OData-VocCap](#ODataVocCap) and a value of `false` do not
support addressing their members by key.

## <a name="AddressingaMemberofanOrderedCollection" href="#AddressingaMemberofanOrderedCollection">4.10 Addressing a Member of an Ordered Collection</a>

Collections can be annotated as ordered using the
[`Core.Ordered`](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/master/vocabularies/Org.OData.Core.V1.md#Ordered)
term (see [OData-VocCore](#ODataVocCore)). Individual items within an
ordered collection of primitive or complex types can be addressed by
appending a segment containing the zero-based ordinal to the URL of the
collection. A negative ordinal number indexes from the end of the
collection, with `-1` representing the last item in the collection.
Services MUST NOT specify a negative index when returning the address of
a member of an ordered collection.

Entity types are stably addressable using their canonical URL and SHOULD
NOT be accessed or accessible using an index.

::: example
Example 35: the first address in a list of addresses for `MainSupplier`
```
http://host/service/MainSupplier/Addresses/0
```
:::

## <a name="AddressingDerivedTypes" href="#AddressingDerivedTypes">4.11 Addressing Derived Types</a>

Any resource path or path expression identifying a collection of
entities or complex type instances can be appended with a  _type-cast segment_, that is a path segment
containing the qualified name of a type derived from the declared item type
of the collection. The result will be restricted to instances of the
derived type and may be empty.

Any resource path or path expression identifying a single entity or
complex type instance can be appended with a type-cast segment containing the
qualified name of a type derived from the declared type of the
identified resource. If used in a resource path and the identified
resource is not an instance of the derived type, the request will result
in a `404 Not Found` response. If used in a path expression,
the type cast will evaluate to `null`.

Services MAY additionally support the use of the unqualified name of a
derived type in a URL by defining one or more default namespaces through
the
[`Core.DefaultNamespace`](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/master/vocabularies/Org.OData.Core.V1.md#DefaultNamespace)
term defined in [OData-VocCore](#ODataVocCore). For more information on
default namespaces, see Default Namespaces in [OData-Protocol](#ODataProtocol).

Services MAY also support treating an instance as a type outside of the
type hierarchy using the same syntax and semantics as when addressing a
derived type. In this case, the set and values of properties of the
addressed type may be different than the properties of the source type.
The set of such possible target types outside of the type hierarchy
SHOULD be called out using the
[`Core.MayImplement`](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/master/vocabularies/Org.OData.Core.V1.md#MayImplement)
annotation term, defined in [OData-VocCore](#ODataVocCore).

```
:::

## <a name="AddressingaSubsetofaCollection" href="#AddressingaSubsetofaCollection">4.12 Addressing a Subset of a Collection</a>

Any resource path or path expression identifying a collection can be
appended with a filter path segment consisting of `/$filter` followed by
parentheses containing a [parameter alias](#ParameterAliases) or a
filter expression following the `filter` syntax rule in
[OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF). If the parentheses contain a parameter alias,
a filter expression MUST be assigned to the parameter alias in the query
part of the request URL. If the filter path segment appears in the
resource path, the filter expression in parentheses MUST NOT use forward slashes,
it must be specified with a parameter alias instead.

The collection will be restricted to instances matching the filter
expression assigned to the parameter alias and may be empty.

The `/$filter` path segment MAY occur multiple times and it MAY be
combined with the [`$filter`](#SystemQueryOptionfilter) system query
option.

::: example
Example 41: red products that cost less than 10  --- combining path
segment and system query option
```
GET Products/$filter(@foo)?@foo=Price lt 10&$filter=Color eq 'red'
```
:::

::: example
Example 42: red products that cost less than 10 --- combine two path
segments
```
GET Products/$filter(@p)/$filter(@c)?@p=Price lt 10&@c=Color eq 'red'
```
:::

::: example
Example 43: categories with less than ten products older than three
```
GET Categories?$filter=Products/$filter(Age gt 3)/$count lt 10
```
:::

Note that the `/$filter` path segment filters the "input" to the
operation, and the `$filter` system query option filters the result of
the operation, so the two can be used interchangeably only for `GET`
operations. For a `PATCH` operation, the `/$filter` path segment is
evaluated on the items *before* the modification and determines which
items are to be modified, whereas the `$filter` system query option is
evaluated *after* the modification and determines which of the modified
items are part of the response.

The `/$filter` path segment MAY be followed by a path segment
identifying a [bound action](#AddressingActions) or [bound

## <a name="AddressingEachMemberofaCollection" href="#AddressingEachMemberofaCollection">4.13 Addressing Each Member of a Collection</a>

To apply a `PATCH` or `DELETE` request to each member of a collection,
clients append the path segment `/$each` to a resource path identifying
a collection.

To apply a [bound action](#AddressingActions) or function to each member
of a collection, clients append the path segment `/$each` followed by a
path segment identifying the [bound action](#AddressingActions) or
function. The response is a collection of instances of the result type
of the bound operation. If the bound operation returns a collection, the
response is a collection of collections. System query options applied to
the response can use [`$it`](#it) to reference an item in the outermost
collection, followed by [`/any`](#any), [`/all`](#all), or
[`/$count`](#AddressingtheCountofaCollection).

The resource path of the collection preceding `/$each` MAY contain
[type-cast segments](#AddressingDerivedTypes) or [filter path
segments](#AddressingaSubsetofaCollection) to subset the collection.

## <a name="AddressingtheMediaStreamofaMediaEntity" href="#AddressingtheMediaStreamofaMediaEntity">4.14 Addressing the Media Stream of a Media Entity</a>

To address the media stream represented by a media entity, clients
append `/$value` to the resource path of the media entity URL. Services
may redirect from this canonical URL to the source URL of the media
stream.

::: example
Example 45: request the media stream for the picture with the key value
`Sunset4321299432`:
```
http://host/service/Pictures('Sunset4321299432')/$value

## <a name="AddressingtheCrossJoinofEntitySets" href="#AddressingtheCrossJoinofEntitySets">4.15 Addressing the Cross Join of Entity Sets</a>

In addition to querying related entities through navigation properties
defined in the entity model of a service, the cross join operator allows
querying across unrelated entity sets.

The cross join is addressed by appending the path segment `$crossjoin`
to the [service root URL](#ServiceRootURL), followed by the
parenthesized comma-separated list of joined entity sets. It returns the
Cartesian product of all the specified entity sets, represented as a
collection of instances of a virtual complex type. Each instance
consists of one non-nullable, single-valued navigation property per
joined entity set. Each such navigation property is named identical to
the corresponding entity set, with a target type equal to the declared
entity type of the corresponding entity set.

The [`$filter`](#SystemQueryOptionfilter) and
[`$orderby`](#SystemQueryOptionorderby) query options can be specified
using properties of the entities in the selected entity sets, prepended
with the entity set as the navigation property name.

The [`$expand`](#SystemQueryOptionexpand) query option can be specified
using the names of the selected entity sets as navigation property
names. If a selected entity set is not expanded, it MUST be represented
using the read URL of the related entity as a navigation link in the
complex type instance.

The [`$count`](#SystemQueryOptioncount),
[`$skip`](#SystemQueryOptionstopandskip), and
[`$top`](#SystemQueryOptionstopandskip) query options can also be used
with no special semantics.

::: example
Example 46: if `Sales` had a structural property `ProductID` instead of
a navigation property `Product`, a "cross join" between `Sales` and
`Products` could be addressed
```
http://host/service/$crossjoin(Products,Sales)?$filter=Products/ID eq Sales/ProductID
```
and would result in
```json
{
  "@odata.context": "http://host/service/$metadata#Collection(Edm.ComplexType)",
  "value": [
    {
      "Products@odata.navigationLink": "Products(0)",

## <a name="AddressingAllEntitiesinaService" href="#AddressingAllEntitiesinaService">4.16 Addressing All Entities in a Service</a>

The symbolic resource `$all`, located at the service root, identifies
the collection of all entities in a service, i.e. the union of all
entity sets plus all singletons.

This symbolic resource is of type `Collection(Edm.EntityType)` and
allows the [`$search`](#SystemQueryOptionsearch) system query option
plus all other query options applicable to collections of entities.

The `$all` resource can be appended with a path segment containing the
qualified name of an entity type in order to restrict the collections to
entities of that type. Query options such as
[`$select`](#SystemQueryOptionselect),
[`$filter`](#SystemQueryOptionfilter),
[`$expand`](#SystemQueryOptionexpand), and
[`$orderby`](#SystemQueryOptionorderby) can be applied to this
restricted set according to the specified type.

## <a name="PassingQueryOptionsintheRequestBody" href="#PassingQueryOptionsintheRequestBody">4.17 Passing Query Options in the Request Body</a>

The query options part of an OData URL can be quite long, potentially
exceeding the maximum length of URLs supported by components involved in
transmitting or processing the request. One way to avoid this is
wrapping the request in a batch request, which has the penalty of
needing to construct a well-formed batch request body.

An easier alternative for `GET` requests is to append `/$query` to the
resource path of the URL, use the `POST` verb instead of `GET`, and pass
the query options part of the URL in the request body.

Requests to paths ending in `/$query` MUST use the `POST` verb. Query
options specified in the request body and query options specified in the
request URL are processed together.

The request body MUST use `Content-Type: text/plain` or `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
It contains the query portion of the URL.

For `Content-Type: text/plain`, the individual query options MUST be separated by `&` or newlines
and MUST use the same percent-encoding as in URLs (especially: no spaces, tabs, or line breaks allowed)
and MUST follow the syntax rules described in [chapter 5](#QueryOptions).

::: example
Example 49: passing a filter condition in the request body
```
POST http://host/service/People/$query
Content-Type: text/plain

$filter=[FirstName,LastName]%20in%20[["John","Doe"],["Jane","Smith"]]
```
This POST request would result from submitting the HTML form
```html
<form method="post" action="http://host/service/People/$query"
      enctype="text/plain">
  <input name="$filter"
    value='[FirstName,LastName]%20in%20[["John","Doe"],["Jane","Smith"]]'>
</form>
```
:::

For content-type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, the individual query options MUST be separated by `&`
and their names and values MAY be percent-encoded even for characters other than `%26` (ampersand) and
`%3D` (equals).

::: example
Example 50: passing multiple system query options in the request body
```
POST http://host/service/People/$query
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

%24filter=LastName+eq+%27P%26G%27&%24select=FirstName,LastName
```
This POST request would result from submitting the HTML form
```html
<form method="post" action="http://host/service/People/$query"
      enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded">
  <input name="$filter" value="LastName eq 'P&G'">
  <input name="$select" value="FirstName,LastName">

and the server must treat it like
```
GET http://host/service/People?
  $filter=LastName%20eq%20'P%26G'&$select=FirstName,LastName

# <a name="QueryOptions" href="#QueryOptions">5 Query Options</a>

The query options part of an OData URL specifies three types of
information: [system query options](#SystemQueryOptions), [custom query
options](#CustomQueryOptions), and [parameter
aliases](#ParameterAliases). All OData services MUST follow the query
string parsing and construction rules defined in this section and its
subsections.

## <a name="SystemQueryOptions" href="#SystemQueryOptions">5.1 System Query Options</a>

System query options are query string parameters that control the amount
and order of the data returned for the resource identified by the URL.
The names of all system query options are optionally prefixed with a
dollar (`$`) character. 4.01 Services MUST support case-insensitive
system query option names specified with or without the `$` prefix.
Clients that want to work with 4.0 services MUST use lower case names
and specify the `$` prefix.

For `GET`, `PATCH`, and `PUT` requests the following rules apply:
- Resource paths identifying a single
entity, a complex type instance, a collection of entities, or a
collection of complex type instances allow
[`$compute`](#SystemQueryOptioncompute),
[`$expand`](#SystemQueryOptionexpand) and
[`$select`](#SystemQueryOptionselect).
- Resource paths identifying a collection
allow [`$filter`](#SystemQueryOptionfilter),
[`$search`](#SystemQueryOptionsearch),
[`$count`](#SystemQueryOptioncount),
[`$orderby`](#SystemQueryOptionorderby),
[`$skip`](#SystemQueryOptionstopandskip), and
[`$top`](#SystemQueryOptionstopandskip).
- Resource paths ending in `/$count` allow
[`$filter`](#SystemQueryOptionfilter) and
[`$search`](#SystemQueryOptionsearch).
- Resource paths not ending in `/$count`
or `/$batch` allow [`$format`](#SystemQueryOptionformat).

For `POST` requests to an action URL the return type of the action
determines the applicable system query options that a service MAY
support, following the same rules as `GET` requests.

`POST` requests to an entity set follow the same rules as `GET` requests
that return a single entity.

System query options SHOULD NOT be applied to a `DELETE` request.

An OData service may support some or all of the system query options
defined. If a data service does not support a system query option, it
MUST reject any request that contains the unsupported option.

The same system query option, irrespective of casing or whether or not
it is prefixed with a `$`, MUST NOT be specified more than once for any
resource.

The semantics of all system query options are defined in the
[OData-Protocol](#ODataProtocol) document.

The grammar and syntax rules for system query options are defined in
[OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF).

Dynamic properties can be used in the same way as declared properties.
If they are not defined on an instance, they evaluate to `null`.

### <a name="CommonExpressionSyntax" href="#CommonExpressionSyntax">5.1.1 Common Expression Syntax</a>

The following operators, functions, and literals can be used in
`$filter`, `$orderby`, and `$compute` expressions.

The [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF) `commonExpr` syntax rule defines the formal
grammar of common expressions.

#### <a name="LogicalOperators" href="#LogicalOperators">5.1.1.1 Logical Operators</a>

OData defines a set of logical operators that evaluate to true or false
(i.e. a `boolCommonExpr` as defined in [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF)).
Logical operators are typically used to filter a collection of
resources.

The syntax rules for the logical operators are defined in
[OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF).  4.01 Services MUST support case-insensitive
operator names. Clients that want to work with 4.0 services MUST use
lower case operator names.

The six comparison operators can be used with all primitive values
except `Edm.Binary`, `Edm.Stream`, and the `Edm.Geo` types.
`Edm.Binary`, `Edm.Stream`, and the `Edm.Geo` types can only be compared
to the `null` value using the [`eq`](#Equals) and [`ne`](#NotEquals)
operators.

When applied to operands of numeric types, [numeric
promotion](#NumericPromotion) rules are applied.

The `eq`, `ne`, and `in` operators can be used with collection-valued
operands, and the `eq` and `ne` operators can be used with operands of a
structured type.

##### <a name="Equals" href="#Equals">5.1.1.1.1 Equals</a>

The `eq` operator returns true if the left operand is equal to the right
operand, otherwise it returns false.

When applied to operands of entity types, the `eq` operator returns true
if both operands represent the same entity, or both operands represent
null.

When applied to operands of complex types, the `eq` operator returns
true if both operands have the same structure and same values, or both
operands represent null.

When applied to ordered collections, the `eq` operator returns true if
both operands have the same cardinality and each member of the left
operand is equal to the corresponding member of the right operand.

For services that support comparing unordered collections, the `eq`
operator returns true if both operands are equal after applying the same
ordering on both collections.

Each of the special values `null`, `-INF`, and `INF` is equal to itself,
and only to itself.

The special value `NaN` is not equal to anything, even to itself.

##### <a name="NotEquals" href="#NotEquals">5.1.1.1.2 Not Equals</a>

The `ne` operator returns true if the left operand is not equal to the
right operand, otherwise it returns false.

When applied to operands of entity types, the `ne` operator returns true
if the two operands do not represent the same entity.

When applied to operands of complex types, the `ne` operator returns
true if the operands do not have the same structure and same values.

When applied to ordered collections, the `ne` operator returns true if
both operands do not have the same cardinality or any member of the left
operand is not equal to the corresponding member of the right operand.

For services that support comparing unordered collections, the `ne`
operator returns true if both operands do not have the same cardinality
or do not contain the same members, in any order.

Each of the special values `null`, `-INF`, and `INF` is not equal to any
value but itself.

The special value `NaN` is not equal to anything, even to itself.

The `null` value is not equal to any value but itself.

##### <a name="GreaterThan" href="#GreaterThan">5.1.1.1.3 Greater Than</a>

The `gt` operator returns true if the left operand is greater than the
right operand, otherwise it returns false.

The special value `INF` is greater than any number, and any number is
greater than `-INF`.

The Boolean value `true` is greater than `false`.

Services SHOULD order language-dependent strings according to the
`Content-Language` of the response, and SHOULD annotate string properties
with language-dependent order with the term
[`Core.IsLanguageDependent`](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/master/vocabularies/Org.OData.Core.V1.md#IsLanguageDependent),
see [OData-VocCore](#ODataVocCore).

If any operand is `null`, the operator returns false.

##### <a name="GreaterThanorEqual" href="#GreaterThanorEqual">5.1.1.1.4 Greater Than or Equal</a>

The `ge` operator returns true if the left operand is greater than or
equal to the right operand, otherwise it returns false.

See rules for [`gt`](#GreaterThan) and [`eq`](#Equals) for details.

##### <a name="LessThan" href="#LessThan">5.1.1.1.5 Less Than</a>

The `lt` operator returns true if the left operand is less than the
right operand, otherwise it returns false.

The special value `-INF` is less than any number, and any number is less
than `INF`.

The Boolean value `false` is less than `true`.

Services SHOULD order language-dependent strings according to the
`Content-Language` of the response, and SHOULD annotate string properties
with language-dependent order with the term
[`Core.IsLanguageDependent`](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/master/vocabularies/Org.OData.Core.V1.md#IsLanguageDependent),
see [OData-VocCore](#ODataVocCore).

If any operand is `null`, the operator returns false.

##### <a name="LessThanorEqual" href="#LessThanorEqual">5.1.1.1.6 Less Than or Equal</a>

The `le` operator returns true if the left operand is less than or equal
to the right operand, otherwise it returns false.

See rules for [`lt`](#LessThan) and [`eq`](#Equals) for details.

##### <a name="And" href="#And">5.1.1.1.7 And</a>

The `and` operator returns true if both the left and right operands
evaluate to true, otherwise it returns false.

The `null` value is treated as unknown, so if one operand evaluates to
`null` and the other operand to false, the `and` operator returns false.
All other combinations with `null` return `null`.

##### <a name="Or" href="#Or">5.1.1.1.8 Or</a>

The `or` operator returns false if both the left and right operands both
evaluate to false, otherwise it returns true.

The `null` value is treated as unknown, so if one operand evaluates to
`null` and the other operand to true, the `or` operator returns true.
All other combinations with `null` return `null`.

##### <a name="Not" href="#Not">5.1.1.1.9 Not</a>

The `not` operator returns true if the operand returns false, otherwise
it returns false.

The `null` value is treated as unknown, so `not null` returns `null`.

##### <a name="Has" href="#Has">5.1.1.1.10 Has</a>

The `has` operator returns true if the right operand is an enumeration
value whose flag(s) are set on the left operand.

The `null` value is treated as unknown, so if one operand evaluates to
`null`, the `has` operator returns `null`.

##### <a name="In" href="#In">5.1.1.1.11 In</a>

The `in` operator returns true if the left operand is a member of the
right operand. The right operand MUST be either a comma-separated list
of primitive values, enclosed in parentheses, or a single expression
that resolves to a collection.

##### <a name="LogicalOperatorExamples" href="#LogicalOperatorExamples">5.1.1.1.12 Logical Operator Examples</a>

The following examples illustrate the use and semantics of each of the
logical operators.

#### <a name="ArithmeticOperators" href="#ArithmeticOperators">5.1.1.2 Arithmetic Operators</a>

OData defines a set of arithmetic operators that require operands that
evaluate to numeric types. Arithmetic operators are typically used to
filter a collection of resources. However, services MAY allow using
arithmetic operators with the [`$orderby`](#SystemQueryOptionorderby)
system query option.

If an operand of an arithmetic operator is null, the result is null.

The syntax rules for the arithmetic operators are defined in
[OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF). 4.01 Services MUST support case-insensitive
operator names. Clients that want to work with 4.0 services MUST use
lower case operator names.

##### <a name="Addition" href="#Addition">5.1.1.2.1 Addition</a>

The `add` operator adds the left and right numeric operands.

For operands of type `Edm.Decimal` the scale of the result is ${\rm scaleof}(A {\ \tt add\ } B) = \max({\rm scaleof}(A), {\rm scaleof}(B))$, or `variable` if any operand has variable scale.

The `add` operator is also valid for the following time-related
operands:
- `DateTimeOffset add Duration` results in
a `DateTimeOffset`
- `Duration add Duration` results in a
`Duration`
- `Date add Duration` results in a `Date`

The rules for time-related operands are defined in
[XML-Schema-2](#XML-Schema2), [section E.3.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#sec-dt-arith).
Specifically, for adding a duration to a date:
- Convert date to datetime (in any timezone) with a zero time component
- Add/subtract duration
- Convert to date by removing the time and timezone components

Thus, today plus a positive duration smaller than one day is today;
today minus a positive duration smaller than one day is yesterday.

##### <a name="Subtraction" href="#Subtraction">5.1.1.2.2 Subtraction</a>

The `sub` operator subtracts the right numeric operand from the left
numeric operand.

For operands of type `Edm.Decimal` the scale of the result is ${\rm scaleof}(A {\ \tt sub\ } B) = \max({\rm scaleof}(A), {\rm scaleof}(B))$,
or `variable` if any operand has variable scale.

The `sub` operator is also valid for the following time-related
operands:
- `DateTimeOffset sub Duration`
results in a `DateTimeOffset`
- `Duration sub Duration` results in a
`Duration`
- `DateTimeOffset sub DateTimeOffset`
results in a `Duration`
- `Date sub Duration` results in a `Date`
- `Date sub Date` results in a `Duration`

The rules for time-related operands are defined in
[XML-Schema-2](#XML-Schema2), [section E.3.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#sec-dt-arith).
Specifically for subtracting a duration from a date see the preceding
[section](#Addition).

##### <a name="Negation" href="#Negation">5.1.1.2.3 Negation</a>

The negation operator, represented by a minus (`-`) sign, changes the
sign of its numeric or `Duration` operand.

##### <a name="Multiplication" href="#Multiplication">5.1.1.2.4 Multiplication</a>

The `mul` operator multiplies the left and right numeric operands. The
`mul` operator is also valid for multiplying a `Duration` value with a
numeric value.

For operands of type `Edm.Decimal` the scale of the result is
${\rm scaleof}(A {\ \tt mul\ } B) = {\rm scaleof}(A) + {\rm scaleof}(B)$,
`floating` if any operand has floating
scale, or else `variable` if any operand has variable scale.

##### <a name="Division" href="#Division">5.1.1.2.5 Division</a>

The `div` and` divby` operators divide the left numeric operand by the
right numeric operand. They are also valid for dividing a `Duration`
value by a numeric value.

If the left operand is of type `Edm.Decimal` with floating scale,
`Edm.Double`, or `Edm.Single`, then positive `div` zero returns `INF`,
negative `div` zero returns `-INF`, and zero `div` zero returns `NaN`.
For all other types the request fails.

For operands of type `Edm.Decimal` the result is
computed with maximal decimal scale. If any operand has floating scale,
the result has floating scale, else if any operand has variable scale,
the result has variable scale. Otherwise the resulting scale is
service-specific, and clients can use `cast` to force the result to a
specific scale.

The `div` and` divby` operators differ in their handling of integers. If
both operands to `div` are of an integer type, the result is an integer
representing the whole number of times the right operator fits into the
left operator. The `divby` operator, on the other hand, promotes both
operands to decimal before computing the result, may yield a fractional
result, and does not fail for `divby` zero, returning `-INF`, `INF`, or
`NaN` depending on the sign of the left operand.

##### <a name="Modulo" href="#Modulo">5.1.1.2.6 Modulo</a>

The `mod` operator returns the remainder when the left numeric operand
is divided by the right numeric operand.  The sign of the result is the
same as the sign of the left operand. If the right operand is zero, the
request fails.

For operands of type `Edm.Decimal` the scale of the result is
${\rm scaleof}(A {\ \tt mod\ } B) = \max({\rm scaleof}(A), {\rm scaleof}(B))$,
or `variable` if any operand has variable scale.

##### <a name="ArithmeticOperatorExamples" href="#ArithmeticOperatorExamples">5.1.1.2.7 Arithmetic Operator Examples</a>

The following examples illustrate the use and semantics of each of the
Arithmetic operators.

::: example
Example 62: all products with a Price of 2.55:
```
http://host/service/Products?$filter=Price add 2.45 eq 5.00

:::

#### <a name="Grouping" href="#Grouping">5.1.1.3 Grouping</a>

The Grouping operator (open and close parenthesis "`( )`") controls the
evaluation order of an expression. The Grouping operator returns the
expression grouped inside the parenthesis.

::: example
Example 69: all products because 9 mod 3 is 0
```
http://host/service/Products?$filter=(4 add 5) mod (4 sub 1) eq 0
```
:::

#### <a name="CanonicalFunctions" href="#CanonicalFunctions">5.1.1.4 Canonical Functions</a>

In addition to operators, a set of functions is also defined for use
with the [`$compute`](#SystemQueryOptioncompute), `$filter` or
[`$orderby`](#SystemQueryOptionorderby) system query options, or in
[parameter alias](#ParameterAliases) values. The following sections
describe the available functions.

Note: ISNULL or COALESCE operators are
not defined. Instead, OData defines a [`null`](#null) literal that can
be used in comparisons.

If a parameter of a canonical function is `null`, the function returns
`null`.

The syntax rules for all functions are defined in
[OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF). 4.01 Services MUST support case-insensitive
canonical function names. Clients that want to work with 4.0 services
MUST use lower case canonical function names.

#### <a name="StringandCollectionFunctions" href="#StringandCollectionFunctions">5.1.1.5 String and Collection Functions</a>

##### <a name="concat" href="#concat">5.1.1.5.1 `concat`</a>

The `concat` function has three overloads, with the following
signatures:

```
Edm.String concat(Edm.String,Edm.String)
Collection concat(Collection,Collection)
OrderedCollection concat(OrderedCollection,OrderedCollection)
```

The `concat` function with string parameter values returns a string that
appends the second parameter string value to the first.

The concat function with collection parameter values returns a
collection that appends all items of the second collection to the first.
If both collections are ordered, the result is also ordered.

The `concatMethodCallExpr` syntax rule defines how the `concat` function
is invoked.

::: example
Example 70: all customers from Berlin, Germany
```
http://host/service/Customers?$filter=concat(concat(City,', '),Country) eq 'Berlin, Germany'
```

##### <a name="cast" href="#cast">5.1.1.10.1 `cast`</a>

The `cast` function has the following signatures:

```
type cast(type)
type cast(expression,type)
```

The single parameter `cast` function returns the current instance cast
to the type specified. The two-parameter `cast` function returns the
object referred to by the expression cast to the type specified.

The `cast` function follows these assignment rules:

1.  The `null` value can be cast to any type.
2.  Primitive types are cast to `Edm.String` or a type definition based on it by using the literal representation used in payloads, and WKT (well-known
    text) format for `Geo` types, see rules
    `fullCollectionLiteral`, `fullLineStringLiteral`,
    `fullMultiPointLiteral`, `fullMultiLineStringLiteral`,
    `fullMultiPolygonLiteral`, `fullPointLiteral`, and
    `fullPolygonLiteral` in
    [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF). The cast fails if the target type specifies an insufficient `MaxLength`.
3.  `Edm.String`, or a type definition based on `Edm.String`, can be cast to a primitive type if the string contains a literal representation for the target type.
4.  Numeric primitive types are cast to each other with appropriate rounding. The cast fails if the integer part doesn't fit into the target type.
5.  `Edm.DateTimeOffset`, `Edm.Duration`, and `Edm.TimeOfDay` values can be cast to the same type with a different precision with appropriate rounding.
6.  Non-Unicode string values can be cast to a Unicode string type definition. Unicode string values can be cast to a non-Unicode string type definition if the Unicode string only contains ASCII characters.
7.  Structured types are assignable to their type or a direct or indirect base type.
8.  Collections are cast item by item.
9.  Enumeration types are cast to integer types based on the numeric value of the enumeration member. The cast fails if the numeric value is not in the value range of the target type.
10. Integer types are cast to enumeration types based on the numeric value of the enumeration members of the target type. For non-flag enumeration types the cast fails if there is no enumeration member with the same numeric value as the integer value. For flag enumeration types the cast fails if the integer value is not in the value range of the underlying integer type of the enumeration type.
11. String values containing a representation of a date-time value according to [XML-Schema-2](#XML-Schema2),
    [section 3.3.7 dateTime](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#dateTime), can be cast to `Edm.DateTimeOffset`.
    If the string value does not contain a time-zone offset, it is treated as UTC.

The `cast` function is optional for primitive values (first five rules)
and up-casts (seventh rule).

If the cast fails, the `cast` function returns `null`.

##### <a name="isof" href="#isof">5.1.1.10.2 `isof`</a>

```
expression case(Edm.Boolean:expression, …, Edm.Boolean:expression)
```

Each parameter is a pair of expressions separated by a colon (`:`),
where the first expression --- the condition --- MUST be a Boolean
expression, and the second expression --- the result --- may evaluate to
any type.

The case function evaluates the condition in each pair, starting with
the leftmost pair, and stops as soon as a condition evaluates to `true`.
It then returns the value of the result of this pair. It returns `null`
if none of the conditions in any pair evaluates to `true`. Clients can
specify a last pair whose condition is `true` to get a non-null
"default/else/otherwise" result.

Boolean expressions containing `DateTimeOffset` or `TimeOfDay` literals without
the optional seconds part will introduce ambiguity for parsers.
Clients SHOULD use whitespace or parentheses to avoid ambiguity.

Clients SHOULD ensure that the results in all pairs are compatible. If
all results are of the same type, the type of the `case` expression is
of that type. If all results are of numeric type, then the type of the
`case` expression is a numeric type capable of representing any of these
expressions according to standard type promotion rules.

Services MAY support `case` expressions containing parameters of
incompatible types, in which case the case expression is treated as
`Edm.Untyped` and its value has the type of the parameter expression
selected by the case statement.

::: example
Example 98: compute signum(X)
```
$compute=case(X gt 0:1,X lt 0:-1,true:0) as SignumX
```

#### <a name="LambdaOperators" href="#LambdaOperators">5.1.1.13 Lambda Operators</a>

OData defines two operators that evaluate a Boolean expression on a
collection. Both must be prepended with a path expression that
identifies a collection.

4.01 Services MUST support case-insensitive lambda operator names.
Clients that want to work with 4.0 services MUST use lower case lambda
operator names.

The argument of a lambda operator is a case-sensitive lambda variable
name followed by a colon (`:`) and a Boolean expression that uses the
lambda variable name to refer to properties of the instance or of members of the collection
identified by the path expression.

If the name chosen for the lambda variable matches a property name of
the current resource referenced by the resource path, the lambda
variable takes precedence. Clients can prefix properties of the current
resource referenced by the resource path with [`$it`](#it).

Other path expressions in the Boolean expression neither prefixed with
the lambda variable nor `$it` are evaluated in the scope of the
instance or of members of the collection at the origin of the path expression prepended to
the lambda operator.

##### <a name="any" href="#any">5.1.1.13.1 `any`</a>

The `any` operator applies a Boolean expression to each member of a
collection and returns true if and only if the expression is true for
any member of the collection, otherwise it returns false. This implies
that the `any` operator always returns false for an empty collection.

The `any` operator can be used without an argument expression. This
short form returns false if and only if the collection is empty.

::: example
Example 99: all `Orders` that have any `Items` with a `Quantity` greater
than `100`
```
http://host/service/Orders?$filter=Items/any(d:d/Quantity gt 100)
```
:::

::: example
Example 100: all customers having an order with a deviating shipping
address. The `Address` in the argument expression is evaluated in the
scope of the `Customers` collection.
```
http://host/service/Customers?$filter=Orders/any(o:o/ShippingAddress ne Address)
```
:::

::: example
Example 101: all categories along with their products used in some order
with a deviating unit price. The unprefixed `UnitPrice` in the argument
expression is evaluated in the scope of the expanded `Products`.
```
http://host/service/Categories?$expand=Products($filter=OrderItems/any(oi:oi/UnitPrice ne UnitPrice))
```
:::

##### <a name="all" href="#all">5.1.1.13.2 `all`</a>

The `all` operator applies a Boolean expression to each member of a
collection and returns true if the expression is true for all members of
the collection, otherwise it returns false. This implies that the `all`
operator always returns true for an empty collection.

The `all` operator cannot be used without an argument expression.

::: example
Example 102: all `Orders` that have only `Items` with a `Quantity`
greater than `100`
```
http://host/service/Orders?$filter=Items/all(d:d/Quantity gt 100)

Primitive literals can appear in the resource path as key property
values, and in the query part, for example, as operands in
[`$filter`](#SystemQueryOptionfilter) expressions. They are represented
according to the `primitiveLiteral` rule in [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF).

:::

Duration literals in OData 4.0 required prefixing with "`duration`".
Enumeration literals in OData 4.0 required prefixing with the qualified
type name of the enumeration.

In OData 4.01, services MUST support duration and enumeration literals
with or without the type prefix. OData clients that want to operate
across OData 4.0 and OData 4.01 services should always include the
prefix for duration and enumeration types.

##### <a name="ComplexandCollectionLiterals" href="#ComplexandCollectionLiterals">5.1.1.14.2 Complex and Collection Literals</a>

Complex literals and collection literals in URLs are represented as JSON
objects and arrays according to the `arrayOrObject` rule in
[OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF). Such literals MUST NOT appear in the path
portion of the URL but can be passed to bound
[functions](#AddressingFunctions) and function imports in path segments
by using [parameter aliases](#ParameterAliases).

Object member values and array items can be expressions, including other
objects and arrays, arithmetic expressions, property names, and of
course primitive values.

Note that the special characters `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, and `"` MUST be
percent-encoded in URLs although some browsers will accept and pass them
on unencoded.

Example 104: collection of string literals
```
http://host/service/ProductsByColors(colors=@c)?@c=["red","green"]

```
:::

##### <a name="null" href="#null">5.1.1.14.3 `null`</a>

The `null` literal can be used to compare a value to null, or to pass a
null value to a function.

##### <a name="it" href="#it">5.1.1.14.4 `$it`</a>

The `$it` literal can be used in expressions to refer to the current
instance of the resource identified by the resource path. For a
collection-valued resource the current instance is the instance
currently being evaluated by the system query option. For a
single-valued resource it is the resource itself.

It allows comparing properties of related entities to properties of the
current instance in expressions within lambda operators or in
[`$filter`](#SystemQueryOptionfilter) expressions nested within
[`$expand`](#SystemQueryOptionexpand) or
[`$select`](#SystemQueryOptionselect).

It also can be used in [`$filter`](#SystemQueryOptionfilter) and
[`$orderby`](#SystemQueryOptionorderby) expressions on collections of
primitive types to refer to the current primitive instance, but using
the [`$this`](#this) literal is preferred as [`$this`](#this) can also
be used in [`$filter`](#SystemQueryOptionfilter) and
[`$orderby`](#SystemQueryOptionorderby) expressions nested within
[`$select`](#SystemQueryOptionselect).

Note: property names and property paths in
[`$filter`](#SystemQueryOptionfilter) expressions nested within
[`$expand`](#SystemQueryOptionexpand) are evaluated in the context of
the declared type of the expanded navigation property, so property names
and property paths for the current instance of the collection identified
by the resource path MUST be prefixed with `$it/`.

The `$it` literal can also be used as a path prefix to invoke a bound
function overload on the current instance within an expression. Function
names without a path prefix refer to an unbound function overload.

::: example
Example 106: email addresses ending with `.com` assuming
`EmailAddresses` is a collection of strings
```
http://host/service/Customers(1)/EmailAddresses?$filter=endswith($it,'.com')
```
:::

::: example
Example 107: customers along with their orders that shipped to the same
city as the customer's address. The nested filter expression is
evaluated in the context of Orders; `$it` allows referring to values in
the outer context of Customers.
Note: the nested filter condition could equivalently be expressed as `$it/Address/City eq `[`$this`](#this)`/ShipTo/City`.
```
http://host/service/Customers?$expand=Orders($filter=$it/Address/City eq ShipTo/City)
```

the same service.

::: example
Example 109: all employees with the same last name as employee `A1235`
```
http://host/service/Employees?$filter=LastName eq $root/Employees('A1245')/LastName

##### <a name="this" href="#this">5.1.1.14.6 `$this`</a>

The `$this` literal can be used in [`$filter`](#SystemQueryOptionfilter)
and [`$orderby`](#SystemQueryOptionorderby) expressions nested within
[`$expand`](#SystemQueryOptionexpand) and
[`$select`](#SystemQueryOptionselect) for collection-valued properties
and navigation properties. It refers to the current instance of the
collection.

```
:::

#### <a name="PathExpressions" href="#PathExpressions">5.1.1.15 Path Expressions</a>

Properties and navigation properties of the structured type on which
a common expression is evaluated can be used as operands
or function parameters, as shown in the preceding examples.

Properties of complex properties can be used via the same syntax as in
resource paths, i.e. by specifying the name of a complex property,
followed by a forward slash (`/`) and the name of a property of the
complex property, and so on,

Properties and navigation properties of entities related with a target
cardinality 0..1 or 1 can be used by specifying the navigation property,
followed by a forward slash (`/`) and the name of a property of the
related entity, and so on.

If a complex property is `null`, or no entity is related (in case of
target cardinality 0..1), its value, and the values of its components,
are treated as `null`.

::: example
Example 113: similar behavior whether `HeadquarterAddress` is a nullable
complex type or a nullable navigation property
```
Companies(1)/HeadquarterAddress/Street
```
:::

To access properties of derived types, the property name MUST be
prefixed with the qualified name of the derived type on which the
property is defined, followed by a forward slash (`/`), see [addressing
derived types](#AddressingDerivedTypes). If the current instance is not
of the specified derived type, the path expression returns `null`.

If the property or navigation property is not defined for the type of
the resource and that type supports dynamic properties or navigation
properties, then the property or navigation property is treated as null
for all instances on which it has no value.

If the property or navigation property is not defined for the type of
the resource and that type does not support dynamic properties or
navigation properties, then the request may be considered malformed.

#### <a name="AnnotationValuesinExpressions" href="#AnnotationValuesinExpressions">5.1.1.16 Annotation Values in Expressions</a>

Services MAY support the use of annotation values as operands or
function parameters, and they MAY advertise this by annotating the
entity container with term
[`Capabilities.AnnotationValuesInQuerySupported`](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/master/vocabularies/Org.OData.Capabilities.V1.md#AnnotationValuesInQuerySupported),
see [OData-VocCap](#ODataVocCap).

Annotation values are referenced by the annotation name which consists
of an at sign (`@`) followed by the qualified term name, optionally
followed by a percent-encoded hash (`%23`) and an annotation qualifier.
The annotation name can be prefixed with a [path
expression](#PathExpressions) leading to the annotated resource or
property.

If an annotation is not applied to the resource or property, then its
value, and the values of its components, are treated as `null`.

::: example
Example 114: Return Products that have prices in Euro
```
http://host/service/Products?$filter=Price/@Measures.Currency eq 'EUR'
```
:::

::: example
Example 115: Return Employees that have any error messages in the
[`Core.Messages`](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/master/vocabularies/Org.OData.Core.V1.md#Messages)
annotation
```
http://host/service/Employees?$filter=@Core.Messages/any(m:m/severity eq 'error')
```
:::

Services MAY additionally support the use of the unqualified term name
by defining one or more default namespaces through the
[`Core.DefaultNamespace`](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/master/vocabularies/Org.OData.Core.V1.md#DefaultNamespace) annotation
term defined in [OData-VocCore](#ODataVocCore). For more information on
default namespaces, see Default Namespaces in [OData-Protocol](#ODataProtocol).
This short notation however uses the same name pattern as parameter
aliases. If a query option is specified as a [parameter
alias](#ParameterAliases), then any occurrence of the parameter alias
name in an expression MUST evaluate to the parameter alias value and
MUST NOT evaluate to the annotation value of an identical unqualified
term name.

#### <a name="OperatorPrecedence" href="#OperatorPrecedence">5.1.1.17 Operator Precedence</a>

OData services MUST use the following operator precedence for supported
operators when evaluating [`$filter`](#SystemQueryOptionfilter) and
[`$orderby`](#SystemQueryOptionorderby) expressions. Operators are
listed by category in order of precedence from highest to lowest.
Operators in the same category have equal precedence:

Group|Operator|Description|ABNF Expression

Conditional OR  | `or`            | Logical Or      | `orExpr`

#### <a name="NumericPromotion" href="#NumericPromotion">5.1.1.18 Numeric Promotion</a>

Services SHOULD NOT require explicit cast operations between numeric
types used in comparison expressions. Wherever possible, such
comparisons should be performed using underlying types of sufficient
size.

Services MAY support numeric promotion for arithmetic operations or when
comparing two operands of comparable types by applying the following
rules, in order:
- If either operand is `Edm.Double`, the other operand is converted to type `Edm.Double`.
- Otherwise, if either operand is `Edm.Single`, the other operand is converted to type `Edm.Single`.
- Otherwise, if either operand is of type `Edm.Decimal`, the other operand is converted to `Edm.Decimal`.
- Otherwise, if either operand is `Edm.Int64`, the other operand is converted to type `Edm.Int64`.
- Otherwise, if either operand is `Edm.Int32`, the other operand is converted to type `Edm.Int32`.
- Otherwise, if either operand is `Edm.Int16`, the other operand is converted to type `Edm.Int16`.

Each of these promotions uses the same semantics as a `castExpression`
to promote an operand to the target type.

OData does not define an implicit conversion between string and numeric
types.

### <a name="SystemQueryOptionfilter" href="#SystemQueryOptionfilter">5.1.2 System Query Option `$filter`</a>

The `$filter` system query option allows clients to filter a collection
of resources that are addressed by a request URL. The expression
specified with `$filter` is evaluated for each resource in the
collection, and only items where the expression evaluates to true are
included in the response. Resources for which the expression evaluates
to false or to null, or which reference properties that are unavailable
due to permissions, are omitted from the response.

The [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF) `filter` syntax rule defines the formal
grammar of the `$filter` query option.

### <a name="SystemQueryOptionexpand" href="#SystemQueryOptionexpand">5.1.3 System Query Option `$expand`</a>

The `$expand` system query option specifies the related resources or
media streams to be included in line with retrieved resources.

The [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF) `expand` syntax rule defines the formal
grammar of the `$expand` query option.

The value of `$expand` is a comma-separated list of expand items. Each
expand item is evaluated relative to the retrieved resource being
expanded. An expand item is either a path or one of the symbols `*` or
`$value`.

A path consists of segments separated by a forward slash (`/`). Segments
are either names of single- or collection-valued complex properties,
[instance annotations](#AnnotationValuesinExpressions), or [type-cast segments](#AddressingDerivedTypes)
consisting of the qualified name of a structured type that is
derived from the type identified by the preceding path segment to reach
properties defined on the derived type.

A path can end with
- the name of a stream property to include
that stream property,
- a star (`*`) to expand all navigation
properties of the identified instances of a structured type, optionally followed by
`/$ref` to expand only entity references, or
- a navigation property to expand the
related entity or entities, optionally followed by a [type-cast segment](#AddressingDerivedTypes)
to expand only related entities of that derived type or one of its
sub-types, optionally followed by `/$ref` to expand only entity
references.
- an entity-valued instance annotation to
expand the related entity or entities, optionally followed by a
[type-cast segment](#AddressingDerivedTypes) to expand only related entities of that derived type
or one of its sub-types.

If a structured type traversed by the path supports neither dynamic
properties nor instance annotations, then a corresponding property
segment MUST specify a declared property of that structured type.
Otherwise, if a traversed type does support dynamic navigation
properties or instance annotations and the corresponding property
segment does not specify a declared property, then the expanded property
appears only for those instances on which it has a value.

::: example
Example 116: expand a navigation property of an entity type
```
http://host/service/Products?$expand=Category
```
:::

::: example
Example 117: expand a navigation property of a complex type
```
http://host/service/Customers?$expand=Addresses/Country
```
:::

A path MUST NOT appear in more than one expand item.

Query options can be applied to an expanded navigation property by
appending a semicolon-separated list of query options, enclosed in
parentheses, to the navigation property name. Allowed system query options are
[`$compute`](#SystemQueryOptioncompute),
[`$select`](#SystemQueryOptionselect),
`$expand`, and [`$levels`](#ExpandOptionlevels) for all navigation properties, plus
[`$filter`](#SystemQueryOptionfilter),
[`$orderby`](#SystemQueryOptionorderby),
[`$skip`](#SystemQueryOptionstopandskip), [`$top`](#SystemQueryOptionstopandskip),
[`$count`](#SystemQueryOptioncount), and
[`$search`](#SystemQueryOptionsearch)  for collection-valued navigation properties.

::: example
Example 118: all categories and for each category all related products
with a discontinued date equal to `null`
```
http://host/service/Categories?$expand=Products($filter=DiscontinuedDate eq null)
```
:::

The `$count` segment can be appended to a navigation property name or
[type-cast segment](#AddressingDerivedTypes) following a navigation
property name to return just the count of the related entities. The
`$filter` and `$search` system query options can be used to limit the
number of related entities included in the count.

::: example
Example 119: all categories and for each category the number of all
related products
```
http://host/service/Categories?$expand=Products/$count
```
:::

::: example
Example 120: all categories and for each category the number of all
related blue products
```
http://host/service/Categories?$expand=Products/$count($search=blue)
```
:::

To retrieve entity references instead of the related entities, append
`/$ref` to the navigation property name or [type-cast segment](#AddressingDerivedTypes) following a navigation property name.
The system query options [`$filter`](#SystemQueryOptionfilter),
[`$search`](#SystemQueryOptionsearch),
[`$skip`](#SystemQueryOptionstopandskip),
[`$top`](#SystemQueryOptionstopandskip), and
[`$count`](#SystemQueryOptioncount) can be used to limit the number of
expanded entity references.

::: example
Example 121: all categories and for each category the references of all
related products
```
http://host/service/Categories?$expand=Products/$ref
```
:::

::: example

```
:::

<a name="ExpandOptionlevels">Cyclic navigation properties (whose target type is identical or can be
cast to its source type) can be recursively expanded using the special
`$levels` option. The value of the `$levels` option is either a positive
integer to specify the number of levels to expand, or the literal string
`max` to specify the maximum expansion level supported by that service.
A `$levels` option with a value of 1 specifies a single expand with no
recursion.</a>

::: example
Example 124: all employees with their manager, manager's manager, and
manager's manager's manager
```
http://host/service/Employees?$expand=ReportsTo($levels=3)
```
:::

It is also possible to expand all declared and dynamic navigation
properties using a star (`*`). To retrieve references to all related
entities use `*/$ref`, and to expand all related entities with a certain
distance use the star operator with the `$levels` option. The star
operator can be combined with explicitly named navigation properties,
which take precedence over the star operator.

The star operator does not implicitly include stream properties.

::: example
Example 125: expand `Supplier` and include references for all other
related entities
```
http://host/service/Categories?$expand=*/$ref,Supplier
```

::: example
Example 126: expand all related entities and their related entities

Specifying a stream property includes the media stream inline according
to the specified format.

::: example
Example 127: include Employee's `Photo` stream property along with other
properties of the customer
```
http://host/service/Employees?$expand=Photo
```
:::

Specifying `$value` for a media entity includes the media entity's
stream value inline according to the specified format.

::: example
Example 128: Include the Product's media stream along with other
properties of the product
```
http://host/service/Products?$expand=$value
```
:::

### <a name="SystemQueryOptionselect" href="#SystemQueryOptionselect">5.1.4 System Query Option `$select`</a>

The `$select` system query option allows clients to request a specific
set of properties for each entity or complex type.

The `$select` query option is often used in conjunction with the
[`$expand`](#SystemQueryOptionexpand) system query option, to define the
extent of the resource graph to return (`$expand`) and then specify a
subset of properties for each resource in the graph (`$select`).
Expanded navigation properties MUST be returned, even if they are not
specified in `$select`.

The [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF) `select` syntax rule defines the formal
grammar of the `$select` query option.

The value of `$select` is a comma-separated list of select items. Each
select item is one of the following:
- a path, to include a property,
- a star (`*`), to include all declared or
dynamic properties of the type, or
- a qualified schema name followed by a
dot (`.`) followed by a star (`*`) to request all applicable actions or
functions from that schema

A path consists of segments separated by a forward slash (`/`). Segments
are either names of single- or collection-valued complex properties,
[instance annotations](#AnnotationValuesinExpressions), or [type-cast segments](#AddressingDerivedTypes) consisting of the qualified name of a structured type that is
derived from the type identified by the preceding path segment to reach
properties defined on the derived type.

A path can end with
- the name of a property or
non-entity-valued instance annotation of the identified
instance of a structured type,
- the qualified name of a bound action,
- the qualified name of a bound function
to include all matching overloads, or
- the qualified name of a bound function
followed by parentheses containing the comma-separated lists of
non-binding parameters identifying a single overload.

The `$select` system query option is interpreted relative to the entity
type or complex type of the resources identified by the resource path
section of the URL. Each select item in the `$select` clause indicates
that the response MUST include the declared or dynamic properties,
actions and functions identified by that select item. If a select item is a path expression traversing an entity or complex property that is `null` on an instance, then
the null-valued entity or complex property is included and represented as `null`.
The simplest form of a select item explicitly requests a property defined on the entity
type of the resources identified by the resource path section of the URL.

::: example
Example 129: rating and release date of all products
```
http://host/service/Products?$select=Rating,ReleaseDate
```
:::

It is also possible to request all declared and dynamic structural
properties using a star (`*`).

::: example
Example 130: all structural properties of all products
```
http://host/service/Products?$select=*
```
:::

If the select item is not defined for the type of the resource, and that
type supports dynamic properties or instance annotations, then the
property is treated as null for all instances on which it is not
defined.

If the select item is not defined for the type of the resource, and that
type does not support dynamic properties or instance annotations, then
the request is considered malformed.

If the select item is an instance annotation of type entity or
collection of entities, then the request is considered malformed.
Entity-valued annotations can be included using
[`$expand`](#SystemQueryOptionexpand).

If the select item is a navigation property, then the corresponding
navigation link is represented in the response. If the navigation
property also appears in an [`$expand`](#SystemQueryOptionexpand) query
option, then it is additionally represented as inline content. This
inline content can itself be restricted with a nested `$select` query
option, see [section 5.1.2](#SystemQueryOptionfilter).

::: example
Example 131: name and description of all products, plus name of expanded
category
```
http://host/service/Products?$select=Name,Description&$expand=Category($select=Name)
```
:::

The select item MUST be prefixed with a qualified structured type name
in order to select a property defined on a type derived from the type of
the resource segment.

A select item that is a complex type or collection of complex type can
be followed by a forward slash, an optional [type-cast segment](#AddressingDerivedTypes), and the name of a property of the
complex type (and so on for nested complex types).

::: example
Example 132: the `AccountRepresentative` property of any supplier that
is of the derived type `Namespace.PreferredSupplier`, together with the
`Street` property of the complex property
`Address`, and the Location property of the derived complex type `Namespace.AddressWithLocation`
```
http://host/service/Suppliers?$select=Namespace.PreferredSupplier/AccountRepresentative,Address/Street,Address/Namespace.AddressWithLocation/Location
```
:::

Query options can be applied to a select item that is a path to a single
complex value or a collection of primitive or complex values by
appending a semicolon-separated list of query options, enclosed in
parentheses, to the select item. The allowed system query options depend
on the type of the resource identified by the select item, see section
[System Query Options](#SystemQueryOptions), with the exception of
[`$expand`](#SystemQueryOptionexpand). The same property MUST NOT have
select options specified in more than one place in a request and MUST
NOT be specified in more than one expand.

::: example
Example 133: select up to five addresses whose `City` starts with an
`H`, sorted, and with the `Country` expanded
```
http://host/service/Customers?$select=Addresses($filter=startswith(City,'H');$top=5;$orderby=Country/Name,City,Street)&$expand=Addresses/Country
```
:::

Any structural property, non-expanded navigation property, or operation
not requested as a select item (explicitly or via a star) SHOULD be
omitted from the response.

Annotations requested in `$select` MUST be included in the response;
`$select` overrules the `include-annotations` preference (see
[OData-Protocol](#ODataProtocol)) for the explicitly requested annotations.
Additional annotations matching the preference can be included even if
not requested via `$select`. The `Preference-Applied` response header
only reflects the set of annotations included due to the
`include-annotations` preference and not those only included due to
`$select`.

If any select item (including a star) is specified, actions and
functions SHOULD be omitted unless explicitly requested.

If an action or function is requested as a select item, either
explicitly by using its qualified name, or implicitly by requesting all
operations in a schema, then the service includes information about how
to invoke that operation for each entity identified by the last path
segment in the request URL for which the operation can be bound.

If an action or function is requested in a select item using its
qualified name and that operation cannot be bound to the entities
requested, the service MUST ignore the select item.

::: example
Example 134: the `ID` property, the `ActionName` action defined in
`Model` and all actions and functions defined in the `Model2` for each
product if those actions and functions can be bound to that product
```
http://host/service/Products?$select=ID,Model.ActionName,Model2.*
```
:::

When multiple select item exist in a `$select` clause, then the total set
of properties, open properties, navigation properties, actions and
functions to be returned is equal to the union of the set of those
identified by each select item.

### <a name="SystemQueryOptionorderby" href="#SystemQueryOptionorderby">5.1.5 System Query Option `$orderby`</a>

The `$orderby` system query option allows clients to request resources
in a particular order.

The semantics of `$orderby` are covered in the [OData-Protocol](#ODataProtocol)
document.

The [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF) `orderby` syntax rule defines the formal
grammar of the `$orderby` query option.

### <a name="SystemQueryOptionstopandskip" href="#SystemQueryOptionstopandskip">5.1.6 System Query Options `$top` and `$skip`</a>

The `$top` system query option requests the number of items in the
queried collection to be included in the result. The `$skip` query
option requests the number of items in the queried collection that are
to be skipped and not included in the result. A client can request a
particular page of items by combining `$top` and `$skip`.

The semantics of `$top` and `$skip` are covered in the
[OData-Protocol](#ODataProtocol) document. The [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF) `top`
and `skip` syntax rules define the formal grammar of the `$top` and
`$skip` query options respectively.

### <a name="SystemQueryOptioncount" href="#SystemQueryOptioncount">5.1.7 System Query Option `$count`</a>

The `$count` system query option allows clients to request a count of
the matching resources included with the resources in the response. The
`$count` query option has a Boolean value of `true` or `false`.

The semantics of `$count` is covered in the [OData-Protocol](#ODataProtocol)
document.

### <a name="SystemQueryOptionsearch" href="#SystemQueryOptionsearch">5.1.8 System Query Option `$search`</a>

The `$search` system query option allows clients to request items within
a collection matching a free-text [search
expression](#SearchExpressions).

The `$search` query option can be applied to a URL representing a
collection of entity, complex, or primitive typed instances, to return
all matching items within the collection. Applying the `$search` query
option to the [`$all`](#AddressingAllEntitiesinaService) resource
requests all matching entities in the service.

If both `$search` and [`$filter`](#SystemQueryOptionfilter) are applied
to the same request, the results include only those items that match
both criteria.

The [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF) `search` syntax rule defines the formal
grammar of the `$search` query option.

::: example
Example 135: all products that are blue or green. It is up to the
service to decide what makes a product blue or green.
```
http://host/service/Products?$search=blue OR green
```
:::

#### <a name="SearchExpressions" href="#SearchExpressions">5.1.8.1 Search Expressions</a>

Search expressions are used within the
[`$search`](#SystemQueryOptionsearch) system query option to request
entities matching the specified expression.
Leading and trailing spaces are not considered part of the search expression.

*Terms* can be any single word to be matched within the expression.

Terms enclosed in double-quotes comprise a *phrase*.

Each individual term or phrase comprises a Boolean expression that
returns true if the term or phrase is matched, otherwise false. The
semantics of what is considered a match is dependent upon the service.

Expressions enclosed in parenthesis comprise a *group expression*.

The search expression can contain any number of terms, phrases, or group
expressions, along with the case-sensitive keywords `NOT`, `AND`, and
`OR`, evaluated in that order.

Expressions prefaced with `NOT` evaluate to true if the expression is
not matched, otherwise false.

Two expressions not enclosed in quotes and separated by a space are
equivalent to the same two expressions separated by the `AND` keyword.
Such expressions evaluate to `true` if both expressions evaluate to
true, otherwise false.

Expressions separated by an `OR` evaluate to true if either of the
expressions evaluate to true, otherwise false.

To support type-ahead use cases, incomplete search expressions can be
sent as OData string literals enclosed in single-quotes, and
single-quotes within the search expression doubled.
Such an expression can also be used to search for double quotes: `?$search='"'`.

The [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF) `searchExpr` syntax rule defines the formal
grammar of the search expression.

### <a name="SystemQueryOptionformat" href="#SystemQueryOptionformat">5.1.9 System Query Option `$format`</a>

The `$format` system query option allows clients to request a response
in a particular format and is useful for clients without access to
request headers for standard content-type negotiation. Where present
`$format` takes precedence over standard content-type negotiation.

The semantics of `$format` is covered in the [OData-Protocol](#ODataProtocol)
document.

The [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF) `format` syntax rule defines the formal
grammar of the `$format` query option.

### <a name="SystemQueryOptioncompute" href="#SystemQueryOptioncompute">5.1.10 System Query Option `$compute`</a>

The `$compute` system query option allows clients to define computed
properties that can be used in a [`$select`](#SystemQueryOptionselect)
or within a [`$filter`](#SystemQueryOptionfilter) or
[`$orderby`](#SystemQueryOptionorderby) expression.

The `$compute` system query option is interpreted relative to the entity
type or complex type of the resources identified by the resource path
section of the URL.

The value of `$compute` is a comma-separated list of compute
instructions, each consisting of a [common
expression](#CommonExpressionSyntax) followed by the keyword `as`,
followed by the name for the computed dynamic property. This name MUST
differ from the names of declared or dynamic properties of the
identified resources.
Services MAY support compute instructions that address
dynamic properties added by other compute instructions within the same
`$compute` system query option, provided that the service can determine an evaluation sequence.

The [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF) `compute` syntax rule defines the formal
grammar of the `$compute` query option.

Computed properties SHOULD be included as dynamic properties in the
result and MUST be included if `$select` is specified with the computed
property name, or star (`*`).

::: example
Example 136: compute total price for order items
```
http://host/service/Orders(10)/Items
  ?$select=Product/Description,Total
  &$filter=Total gt 100
  &$orderby=Total
  &$compute=Product/Price mul Quantity as Total
```
:::

### <a name="SystemQueryOptionindex" href="#SystemQueryOptionindex">5.1.11 System Query Option `$index`</a>

The `$index` system query option allows clients to do a positional
insert into a collection annotated with the
[`Core.PositionalInsert`](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/master/vocabularies/Org.OData.Core.V1.md#PositionalInsert)
term (see [OData-VocCore](#ODataVocCore)). The value of the `$index`
system query option is the zero-based ordinal position where the item is
to be inserted. The ordinal of items within the collection greater than
or equal to the inserted position are increased by one. A negative
ordinal indexes from the end of the collection, with -1 representing an
insert at the end of the collection.

The [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF) `index` syntax rule defines the formal
grammar of the `$index` query option.

### <a name="SystemQueryOptionschemaversion" href="#SystemQueryOptionschemaversion">5.1.12 System Query Option `$schemaversion`</a>

The `$schemaversion` system query option allows clients to specify the
version of the schema against which the request is made. The semantics
of `$schemaversion` is covered in the [OData-Protocol](#ODataProtocol) document.

The [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF) `schemaversion` syntax rule defines the
formal grammar of the `$schemaversion` query option

## <a name="CustomQueryOptions" href="#CustomQueryOptions">5.2 Custom Query Options</a>

Custom query options provide an extensible mechanism for
service-specific information to be placed in a URL query string. A
custom query option is any query option of the form shown by the rule
`customQueryOption` in [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF).

Custom query options MUST NOT begin with a `$` or `@` character.

::: example
Example 137: service-specific custom query option `debug-mode`
```
http://host/service/Products?debug-mode=true
```
:::

## <a name="ParameterAliases" href="#ParameterAliases">5.3 Parameter Aliases</a>

Parameter aliases can be used in place of literal values in entity keys,
[function](#AddressingFunctions) parameters, or within a
[`$filter`](#SystemQueryOptionfilter) or
[`$orderby`](#SystemQueryOptionorderby) expression.

Parameter aliases MUST start with an `@` character, see rule
`parameterAlias` in [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF).

The semantics of parameter aliases are covered in
[OData-Protocol](#ODataProtocol). The [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF) rule
`aliasAndValue` defines the formal grammar for passing parameter alias
values as query options.

::: example
Example 138:
```
http://host/service/Movies?$filter=contains(@word,Title)&@word='Black'
```
:::

::: example
Example 139:
```
http://host/service/Movies?$filter=Title eq @title&@title='Wizard of Oz'
```
:::

::: example
Example 140: JSON array of strings as parameter alias value --- note that
`[`, `]`, and `"` need to be percent-encoded in real URLs, the
clear-text representation used here is just for readability
```
http://host/service/Products/Model.WithIngredients(Ingredients=@i)?@i=["Carrots","Ginger","Oranges"]
