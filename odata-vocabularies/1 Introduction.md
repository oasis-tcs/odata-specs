# ##sec Introduction

OData provides the ability to decorate model elements of a schema and instances of data with descriptive elements called annotations. Annotations can be used to specify additional facts about an element, such as whether it is read-only, or to define a common concept, such as a person or a movie. Annotations consist of a term (the namespace-qualified name of the annotation being applied), a target (the element to which the term is applied), and a value. A set of related annotation terms with a common namespace comprises a Vocabulary. Shared vocabularies provide a powerful extensibility point for OData. Refer to the [OData-Protocol](#ODataProtocol) and [OData-CSDL](#ODataCSDL) specifications for more information on the use of vocabularies.

This prose specification describes a set of OData vocabularies maintained by the OASIS OData Technical Committee. It is one component of a Work Product that also includes the various vocabulary components. These vocabulary components are continuously evolved, the latest work-in-progress revisions are available at [OData-Vocabs](#ODataVocabs).

Other OData vocabularies may be created, shared, and maintained outside of this work product.
