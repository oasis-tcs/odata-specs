Here is a customized command line which will generate HTML from this markdown file (named `$$$filename$$$.md`). Line breaks are added for readability only:

```
pandoc -f gfm+tex_math_dollars+fenced_divs
       -t html
       -o $$$filename$$$.html
       -c styles/markdown-styles-v1.7.3b.css
       -c styles/odata.css
       -s
       --mathjax
       --eol=lf
       --wrap=none
       --metadata pagetitle="$$$pagetitle$$$"
       $$$filename$$$.md
```
