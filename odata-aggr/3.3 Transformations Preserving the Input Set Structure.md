## ##subsec Transformations Preserving the Input Set Structure

These transformations produce an output set that is a subset of their input set. Some of the algorithmic descriptions that follow make use of the following definition: A total order of a collection is called stable across requests if it is the same for all requests that construct the collection by executing the same resource path and transformations, possibly nested, on the same underlying data.

::: example
⚠ Example ##ex: A stable total order is required for the input set of a [`skip`](#Transformationskip) transformation. The following request constructs that input set by executing the `Sales` resource path and the `groupby` transformation, computing the total sales per customer. Because of the subsequent `skip` transformation, the service must endow this with a stable total order. In other words, the request divides the total sales per customer into pages of $N$ customers and returns page number $i$ in a reproducible manner (as long as the underlying data do not change).
```
GET /service/Sales?$apply=
  groupby((Customer),aggregate(Amount with sum as Total))
  /skip(M)/top(N)
```
where the number in `skip` is $M=(i-1)⋅N$.

### ##subsubsec Top/bottom transformations

These transformations take two parameters. The first parameter MUST be an [expression](#Expression) that is [evaluable on the input set as a collection](#ExpressionsEvaluableonaCollection), without reference to an individual instance (and which therefore cannot be a property path). The second parameter MUST be an expression that is evaluated on each instance of the input set in turn.

The output set is constructed as follows:
1. Let $A$ be a copy of the input set with a total order that need not extend any existing order but is completely chosen by the service. The total order MUST be stable across requests. ($A$'s is the order of the eventual output set of this transformation.)
2. Let $B$ be a copy of $A$ that is [stable-sorted](#SamesnessandPrecedence) in ascending (for transformations starting with `bottom`) or descending (for transformations starting with `top`) order of the value specified in the second parameter. ($B$'s is the order in which contributions to the output set are considered.)
3. Start with an empty output set.
4. Loop over $B$ in its total order.
5. Exit the loop if a condition is met. This condition depends on the transformation being executed and is given in the subsections below.
6. Insert the current item of the loop into the output set in the order of $A$.
7. Continue the loop.

For example, if the input set consists of non-transient entities and the datastore contains an index ordered by the second parameter and then the entity-id, a service may implement this algorithm with $A=B$ ordered like this index.

The order of the output set can be influenced with a subsequent [`orderby`](#Transformationorderby) transformation.

#### ##subsubsubsec Transformations `bottomcount` and `topcount`

The first parameter MUST evaluate to a positive integer $c$. The second parameter MUST evaluate to a primitive type whose values are totally ordered. In step 5, exit the loop if the cardinality of the output set equals $c$.

::: example
Example ##ex:
```
GET /service/Sales?$apply=bottomcount(2,Amount)
```
results in
```
{
  "@odata.context": "$metadata#Sales"
  "value": [
    { "ID": 1, "Amount": 1 },
    { "ID": 7, "Amount": 1 }
  ]
}
```
:::

::: example
Example ##ex:
```
GET /service/Sales?$apply=topcount(2,Amount)
```
results in
```
{
  "@odata.context": "$metadata#Sales",
  "value": [
    { "ID": 3, "Amount": 4 },
    { "ID": 4, "Amount": 8 }
  ]
}
```
Note that two `Sales` entities with the second highest amount 4 exist in the input set; the entity with `ID` 3 is included in the result, because the service chose to use the `ID` property for imposing a stable ordering in step 1. Such a logic needs to be in place even with a preceding `orderby` since it cannot be ensured that it creates a stable order of the instances on the expressions of the second parameter.

#### ##subsubsubsec Transformations `bottompercent` and `toppercent`

The first parameter MUST evaluate to a positive number $p$ less than or equal to 100. The second parameter MUST evaluate to a number. In step 5, exit the loop if the ratio of the sum of the numbers addressed by the second parameter in the output set to their sum in the input set equals or exceeds $p$%.

::: example
Example ##ex:
```
GET /service/Sales?$apply=bottompercent(50,Amount)
```
results in
```
{
  "@odata.context": "$metadata#Sales",
  "value": [
    { "ID": 1, "Amount": 1 },
    { "ID": 2, "Amount": 2 },
    { "ID": 5, "Amount": 4 },
    { "ID": 6, "Amount": 2 },
    { "ID": 7, "Amount": 1 },
    { "ID": 8, "Amount": 2 }
  ]
}
```
:::

::: example
Example ##ex:
```
GET /service/Sales?$apply=toppercent(50,Amount)
```
results in
```
{
  "@odata.context": "$metadata#Sales",
  "value": [
    { "ID": 3, "Amount": 4 },
    { "ID": 4, "Amount": 8 }
  ]
}
```
:::

#### ##subsubsubsec Transformations `bottomsum` and `topsum`

The first parameter MUST evaluate to a number $s$. The second parameter MUST be an [aggregatable expression](#AggregatableExpression) that evaluates to a number. In step 5, exit the loop if the sum of the numbers addressed by the second parameter in the output set is greater than or equal to a non-negative $s$ or is less than or equal to a negative $s$.

::: example
Example ##ex:
```
GET /service/Sales?$apply=bottomsum(7,Amount)
```
results in
```
{
  "@odata.context": "$metadata#Sales",
  "value": [
    { "ID": 1, "Amount": 1 },
    { "ID": 2, "Amount": 2 },
    { "ID": 6, "Amount": 2 },
    { "ID": 7, "Amount": 1 },
    { "ID": 8, "Amount": 2 }
  ]
}
```
:::

::: example
Example ##ex:
```
GET /service/Sales?$apply=topsum(15,Amount)
```
results in
```
{
  "@odata.context": "$metadata#Sales",
  "value": [
    { "ID": 3, "Amount": 4 },
    { "ID": 4, "Amount": 8 },
    { "ID": 5, "Amount": 4 }
  ]
}
```
:::

### ##subsubsec Transformation `filter`

The `filter` transformation takes a Boolean expression that could also be passed as a `$filter` system query option. Its output set is the subset of the input set containing all instances (possibly with repetitions) for which this expression, evaluated relative to the instance, yields true. No order is defined on the output set.

::: example
Example ##ex:
```
GET /service/Sales?$apply=filter(Amount gt 3)
```
results in
```
{
  "@odata.context": "$metadata#Sales",
  "value": [
    { "ID": 3, "Amount": 4 },
    { "ID": 4, "Amount": 8 },
    { "ID": 5, "Amount": 4 }
  ]
}
```
:::

### ##subsubsec Transformation `identity`

The output set of the `identity` transformation is its input set in unchanged order.

::: example
Example ##ex: Add a grand total row to the `Sales` result set
```
GET /service/Sales?$apply=concat(identity,aggregate(Amount with sum as Total))
```
:::

### ##subsubsec Transformation `orderby`

The `orderby` transformation takes a list of expressions that could also be passed as a `$orderby` system query option. Its output set consists of the instances of the input set in the same order `$orderby` would produce for the given expressions, but keeping the relative order from the input set if the given expressions do not distinguish between two instances. The orderby transformation thereby performs a [stable-sort](#SamenessandPrecedence). A service supporting this transformation MUST at least offer sorting by values addressed by property paths, including dynamic properties, with both suffixes `asc` and `desc`.

::: example
Example ##ex:
```
GET /service/Sales?$apply=groupby((Product/Name),
                           aggregate(Amount with sum as Total))
                   /orderby(Total desc)
```
results in
```
{
  "@odata.context": "$metadata#Sales(Product(Name),Total)",
  "value": [
    { "Product": { "Name": "Coffee" },
      "Total@odata.type": "Decimal", "Total": 12 },
    { "Product": { "Name": "Paper" },
      "Total@odata.type": "Decimal", "Total":  8 },
    { "Product": { "Name": "Sugar" },
      "Total@odata.type": "Decimal", "Total":  4 }
  ]
}
```
:::

### ##subsubsec Transformation `search`

The `search` transformation takes a search expression that could also be passed as a `$search` system query option. Its output set is the subset of the input set containing all instances (possibly with repetitions) that match this search expression. Closing parentheses in search expressions must be within single or double quotes in order to avoid syntax errors like `search())`. No order is defined on the output set.

::: example
Example ##ex: assuming that free-text search on `Sales` takes the related product name into account,
```
GET /service/Sales?$apply=search(coffee)
```
results in
```
{
  "@odata.context": "$metadata#Sales",
  "value": [
    { "ID": 3, "Amount": 4 },
    { "ID": 4, "Amount": 8 }
  ]
}
```
:::

### ##subsubsec Transformation `skip`

The `skip` transformation takes a non-negative integer $c$ as argument. Let $A$ be a copy of the input set with a total order that extends any existing order of the input set but is otherwise chosen by the service. The total order MUST be stable across requests.

The transformation excludes from the output set the first $c$ instances of $A$. It keeps all remaining instances in the same order as they occur in $A$.

::: example
Example ##ex:
```
GET /service/Sales?$apply=orderby(Customer/Name desc)/skip(2)/top(2)
```
results in
```
{
  "@odata.context": "$metadata#Sales"
  "value": [
    { "ID": 6, "Amount": 2 },
    { "ID": 7, "Amount": 1 }
  ]
}
```
:::

### ##subsubsec Transformation `top`

The `top` transformation takes a non-negative integer $c$ as argument. Let $A$ be a copy of the input set with a total order that extends any existing order of the input set but is otherwise chosen by the service. The total order MUST be stable across requests.

If $A$ contains more than $c$ instances, the output set consists of the first $c$ instances of $A$. Otherwise, the output set equals $A$. The instances in the output set are in the same order as they occur in $A$.

Note the transformation `top(0)` produces an empty output set.

::: example
Example ##ex:
```
GET /service/Sales?$apply=orderby(Customer/Name desc)/top(2)
```
results in
```
{
  "@odata.context": "$metadata#Sales"
  "value": [
    { "ID": 4, "Amount": 8 },
    { "ID": 5, "Amount": 4 }
  ]
}
```
:::

### ##subsubsec Stable Total Order Before `$skip` and `$top`

When the system query options `$top` and `$skip` [OData-Protocol, sections 11.2.6.3 and 11.2.6.4](#ODataProtocol) are executed after the system query option `$apply` and after `$filter` and `$orderby`, if applicable, they operate on a collection with a total order that extends any existing order but is otherwise chosen by the service. The total order MUST be stable across requests.
