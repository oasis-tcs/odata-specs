### ##subsubsec Definitions of Terms

This specification defines the following terms:
- <a name="AggregatableExpression">_Aggregatable Expression_</a> – an [expression](#Expression) resulting in a value of an [aggregatable primitive type](#AggregatablePrimitiveType)
- <a name="AggregatablePrimtiveType">_Aggregatable Primitive Type_</a> – a primitive type other than `Edm.Stream` or subtypes of `Edm.Geography` or `Edm.Geometry`
- <a name="DataAggregationPath">_Data Aggregation Path_</a> – a path that consists of one or more segments separated by a forward slash. Segments are names of declared or dynamic structural or navigation properties, or type-cast segments consisting of the (optionally qualified) name of a structured type that is derived from the type identified by the preceding path segment to reach properties declared by the derived type.
- <a name="Expression">_Expression_</a> – derived from the `commonExpr` rule (see [OData-ABNF](#ODataABNF)). Certain expressions are evaluated relative to a "current instance", while other expressions introduced in this document are evaluated to a "current collection", see [example ##collexpr].
- <a name="SingleValuedPropertyPath">_Single-Valued Property Path_</a> – property path ending in a single-valued primitive, complex, or navigation property

### ##subsubsec Acronyms and Abbreviations

- $A,I,U$ – collections of instances
- $H$ – hierarchical collection
- $u,w$ – instances in a collection
- $x,y$ – instances in a hierarchical collection, called nodes
- $p,q,v$ – paths
- $S,T$ – transformation sequences
- $\Gamma(A,v)$ – the collection that results from evaluating a [data aggregation path](#DataAggregationPath) $v$ relative to a collection $A$, defined [below](#EvaluationofDataAggregationPaths)
- $γ(u,v)$ – the collection that results from evaluating a [data aggregation path](#DataAggregationPath) $v$ relative to an instance $u$, defined [below](#EvaluationofDataAggregationPaths)
- $\Pi_G(s)$ – a transformation of a collection that injects grouping properties into every instance of the collection, defined [below](#SimpleGrouping)
