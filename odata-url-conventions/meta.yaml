description:
  The Open Data Protocol (OData) enables the creation of REST-based data services,
  which allow resources, identified using Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and
  defined in an Entity Data Model (EDM), to be published and edited by Web clients
  using simple HTTP messages.
  This specification defines a set of recommended (but not required) rules for
  constructing URLs to identify the data and metadata exposed by an OData service
  as well as a set of reserved URL query string operators.
