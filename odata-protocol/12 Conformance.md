# ##sec Conformance

OData is designed as a set of conventions that can be layered on top of
existing standards to provide common representations for common
functionality. Not all services will support all of the conventions
defined in the protocol; services choose those conventions defined in
OData as the representation to expose that functionality appropriate for
their scenarios.

To aid in client/server interoperability, this specification defines
multiple levels of conformance for an OData Service, as well as the
[minimal requirements](#InteroperableODataClients) for an OData Client
to be interoperable across OData services.

## ##subsec OData 4.0 Service Conformance Levels

OData 4.0 defines three levels of conformance for an OData Service.

Note: The conformance levels are design to correspond to different
service scenarios. For example, a service that publishes data compliant
with one or more of the OData defined formats may comply with the [OData
4.0 Minimal Conformance Level](#OData40MinimalConformanceLevel) without
supporting any additional functionality. A service that offers more
control over the data that the client retrieves may comply with the
[OData 4.0 Intermediate Conformance
Level](#OData40IntermediateConformanceLevel). Services that conform to
the [OData 4.0 Advanced Conformance Level](#OData40AdvancedConformanceLevel) can expect to interoperate with
the most functionality against the broadest range of generic clients.

Services can advertise their level of conformance by annotating their
entity container with the term
[`Capabilities.ConformanceLevel`](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/master/vocabularies/Org.OData.Capabilities.V1.md#ConformanceLevel)
defined in [OData-VocCap](#ODataVocCap).

Note: Services are encouraged to support as much additional
functionality beyond their level of conformance as is appropriate for
their intended scenario.

### ##subsubsec OData 4.0 Minimal Conformance Level

In order to conform to the OData 4.0 Minimal conformance level, a
service:

1. MUST publish a service document at the
service root ([section ##ServiceDocumentRequest])

## ##subsec OData 4.01 Service Conformance Levels

OData services can report conformance to the OData 4.01 specification by

annotation, as defined in [OData-VocCore](#ODataVocCore). As all OData
4.01 compliant services must also be fully OData 4.0 compliant, OData
4.01 services do not need to separately list `4.0` as a supported
version.

## ##subsec Interoperable OData Clients

Interoperable OData clients can expect to work with OData Services that
comply with at least the [OData 4.0 Minimal Conformance
