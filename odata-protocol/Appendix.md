# Appendix ##asec Safety, Security and Privacy Considerations

This section is provided as a service to the application developers,
information providers, and users of OData version 4.0 giving some
references to starting points for securing OData services as specified.
OData is a REST-full multi-format service that depends on other services
and thus inherits both sides of the coin, security enhancements and
concerns alike from the latter.

For HTTP relevant security implications please cf. the relevant sections
of [RFC9110](#rfc9110) (17. Security Considerations) and for the
HTTP `PATCH` method [RFC5789](#rfc5789) (5. Security Considerations) as
starting points.

## ##subasec Authentication

OData Services requiring authentication SHOULD consider supporting basic
authentication as defined in [RFC7617](#rfc7617) over HTTPS for the
highest level of interoperability with generic clients. They MAY support
other authentication methods.

As stated in the OASIS IPR Policy, the following three paragraphs in brackets apply to OASIS Standards Final Deliverable documents (Committee Specification, Candidate OASIS Standard, OASIS Standard, or Approved Errata).

\[OASIS requests that any OASIS Party or any other party that believes it has patent claims that would necessarily be infringed by implementations of this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable, to notify OASIS TC Administrator and provide an indication of its willingness to grant patent licenses to such patent claims in a manner consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS Technical Committee that produced this deliverable.\]

\[OASIS invites any party to contact the OASIS TC Administrator if it is aware of a claim of ownership of any patent claims that would necessarily be infringed by implementations of this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable by a patent holder that is not willing to provide a license to such patent claims in a manner consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS Technical Committee that produced this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable. OASIS may include such claims on its website, but disclaims any obligation to do so.\]

\[OASIS takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable or the extent to which any license under such rights might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it has made any effort to identify any such rights. Information on OASIS' procedures with respect to rights in any document or deliverable produced by an OASIS Technical Committee can be found on the OASIS website. Copies of claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to obtain a general license or permission for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or users of this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable, can be obtained from the OASIS TC Administrator. OASIS makes no representation that any information or list of intellectual property rights will at any time be complete, or that any claims in such list are, in fact, Essential Claims.\]
